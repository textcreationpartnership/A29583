         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who in his ſeuerall Treatiſes abridged in this Booke entitled SANCTA SOPHIA, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably out of his ovvne experience, hath methodically, ſolidely, clearely and piouſly ſet forth ſuch efficacious Inſtructions for the attaining of true Perfection; that all deuout ſoules aſpiring thereto, eſpecially Religious perſons (vvhole dayly practiſe of Meditation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Exerciſes tending to that end, vvill if vvell applyed much aduance them) by their practiſe vvith great facility, may attaine great Perfection.

                     <p n="3">3. Now the principall, yea onely Point that giues ſome this Iealouſy, is that vvhich thou vvilt find in the

And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the most eſſentiall, Vniuerſall Duty to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired vnto by euery one that pretends a deſire or intention to walke in the ſame Pathes is, to giue vp his Soule and all its Faculties to Gods Internall Guidance and Direction only, relinquishing and renouncing all other Instructours and Instructions as far as they are not ſubordinately coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating vvith this our Diuine Maiſter: For the receiuing of vvhoſe Celestiall Influences, the humble and devout Scholler is obliged to prepare and diſpoſe himſelfe by Prayer, Abstraction of Life &amp;c, in Solitude hearkning to his Voyce &amp; Call, and learning how to diſtinguish it clearely from the Voyce &amp; Sollicitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Humane Reaſon or Corrupt Nature: till that by long familiarity &amp; conuerſation with God, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue alone will ſo cleare his ſpirituall ſight that he shall ſee at last no other Light, nor receiue Motion from any other, but God only, &amp; this in all Actions, Omiſsions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, though in themſelues of the ſmallest importance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This is our <hi>Venerable Authours Doctrine</hi> every vvhere in all his <hi>Treatiſes</hi> (vvhat euer the Subiect be) inculcated, and euen to the vvearying of the Readers, continually repeated and aſſerted. Indeed <hi>a Doctrine</hi>
                        <pb n="IV" facs="tcp:48407:10"/> it is ſo <hi>fundamentall</hi> to all his other <hi>Inſtructions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> &amp;c, that the leaſt vveakning of its authority renders all the reſt vnprof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But little reaſon there is to feare that <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> vvhich is the <hi>very Soule of Christianity,</hi> can be shaken by humane oppoſition, or diſparaged by jealouſy.

Now vvhat is vvas that troubled them, vvill appeare from the only <hi>Obiection</hi> in the <hi>Authours life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi> made againſt it, vvhich vvas indeed a mere <hi>Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,</hi> leaſt this <hi>doctrine ſo deliuered</hi> should <hi>preiudice the Authority of Superiours.</hi> The vvhich <hi>Obiection He</hi> anſvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the full ſatisfaction of all that vvere intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the matter.

And the vnion which Adam during his ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency did &amp; would allwaies haue practiſed, was in a ſort perpetuall, neuer being interrupted (except perhaps in ſleepe:) For louing God only &amp; purely for himſelfe, he had no ſtrange affection to diſtract him, and the Images of creatures, which either by his conſideration of them, or operations about them, did adhere to his internall ſenſes, did not at all diuert his mind from God, becauſe he contemplated them only in order to God; or rather he contemplated God alone in them, louing &amp; ſeruing him only in all his reflexions on them, or workings about them. So that creatures and all offices towards them ſerued as ſtepps to raiſe Adam to a more ſublime &amp; more intime vnion with God; the which was both his duty &amp; his preſent happines, beſides that it was a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his future, eternall beatitude.</p>

But our firſt parents by a willfull contempt &amp; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of that one moſt eaſy command, which God for a tryall of their obedience had impoſed on them, not only broke the foreſaid vnion, &amp; depriued themſelues of the hope of enioying God eternally in the future life: But moreouer were vtterly deueſted of all ſupernaturall graces, &amp; extremely weakened &amp; diſordered in all their naturall Gifts. So that hauing loſt that diuine light, by which their vnderſtandings had bene illuſtrated, &amp; that Diuine loue by which their wills &amp; affections adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red continually to God, they were rendred incapable either of contemplating God (except onlie as a ſeuere

On the contrary both their minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were only emploied on themſelues, or on creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, for their owne naturall, carnall intereſts or pleaſure; &amp; this with ſuch a violent obſtinacy &amp; firmenes, that it was impoſſible for them by any force left in corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to raiſe their loue tovvards God, being once ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly precipitated from him tovvards themſelues.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48407:32"/> in all ſoules a certaine propenſion to ſeeke God (though not at all for himſelfe, but meerelie for the ſatisfaction of nature, &amp; ſelfe-ends) vvhich is a kind of Naturall Deuotion, &amp; is to be found euen in hereticks, yea Iewes &amp; heathens; &amp; this more or leſſe according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall diſpoſitions &amp; corporall complexions; the varietie of vvhich is vvonderfull &amp; almoſt incredible.

And conſequently ſuch ſoules are not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues much inclined to externall vvorkes (except vvhen God calls them thereto by ſecret Inſpirations, or ingages them therin by command of Superiours) but they ſeeke rather to purifie themſelues &amp; inflame their hearts in the loue of God by Internall, quiet &amp; pure Actuations

By a Conſtant pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of ſuch Exerciſes their Spirits becoming naked &amp; empty of all ſtrange Affections, Images &amp; Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Diuine ſpirit only liues &amp; operates in them, affording them Light to perceiue &amp; ſtrength to ſubdue ſelfe-loue in its moſt ſecret, and to all others impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſinuations. And by Conſequence they attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Vnion vvith God farre more ſtrickt &amp; immediate then the former, by a loue much more Maſculine, pure &amp; Diuine.

                        <p n="6">6. Now though all Internall Diſpoſitions of ſoules (by wich Mankind is more diuerſified then by outward features) may conueniently enough be ranged vnder theſe two ſtates: yet wee are not to conceiue that each ſoule is by its temper entirely &amp; abſolutely either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue or Actiue: For on the contrary the moſt part are of a Diſpoſition mixd betweene both, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſomewhat, more or leſſe, of each: But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Denomination from that whereto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is more ſtrong.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And from hence comes that great Difficulty that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48407:33"/> there is in the Conducting and Managing of ſoules in theſe Internall waies: For each ſeuerall Diſpoſition muſt be put in a way ſuitable to the ſpirit of the party, otherwiſe ſmall progreſſe can be expected. Now that wherin the diuerſity of Spirits is principally diſcern'd, is their Praier. If therefore an Actiue Spirit should be obliged to that Internall ſolitude, to that quiet Affectiue Praier of the Heart alone which is proper to Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Soules: Or if a Contemplatiue ſpirit should be too long deteined or fettred with the Rules &amp; buſy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Diſcourſiue Meditation (which is a Prayer cheifly of the Head or Imagination:) Or laſtly if a ſpirit of a Mixt Diſpoſition should be ſtrictly confined to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ſortes of Praier &amp; not allowed to practiſe them interchangeably according as she finds profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her preſent temper of minde &amp;c. They would entangle themſelues with inſuperable Difficulties, ſcrupuloſities and vnſatisfaction, and be ſo farre from any conſiderable aduancement, that they would be in danger of giuing ouer all thought of ſeeking God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Notwithſtanding although the Propenſions of ſome ſoules to Internall Operations of the Spirit, and conſequently to Contemplation, vvere neuer ſo ſtrong: Yet at their firſt entrance into a Sprituall courſe, they vvill ordinarily ſpeaking, ſeeme to be of an Actiue, extrouerted temper, and conſequently vvill not be capable of a long continued rigorous ſolitude, nor of Operations purely Spirituall. They vvill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be forced to begin vvith Exerciſes of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48407:34"/> and Diſcourſiue Praier. And the reaſon is, becauſe by their former Secular, negligent &amp; Extro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted life, their mind is ſo filled &amp; painted all ouer vvith the Images of Creatures, &amp; their Hearts ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred &amp; diuided vvith inordinate Affections &amp; Paſſions, that the vvill alone vvith its, Actuations, purpoſes and reſolutions has not povver to expell the ſaid Images &amp; to aſſvvage the ſaid Paſſions.

                        <p n="7">7. The effects of this bleſſed, perceptible Preſence of God in perfect ſoules are vnſpeakable &amp; diuine. For he is in them both as a Principle of all their actions Internall &amp; Externall, being the life of their life and ſpirit of their ſpirits: and alſo as the End of them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting both the actions &amp; perſons to himſelfe only. <hi>He is all in all</hi> things vnto them: A light to direct ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all their ſteps, and to order all their vvorkings, euen thoſe also vvhich ſeeme the moſt indifferent, the vvhich by the guidance of Gods holy ſpirit doe cauſe a farther aduancement of them to a yet more immediate vnion.

They not only beleiue &amp; knovv, but euen feele &amp; taſt him to be the vniuerſall, Infinite Good.

                        <p n="1">1. THe end of a <hi>Contemplatiue life</hi> therfore being ſo ſupereminently noble and Diuine, that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ſoules doe proſecute the ſame, and no other, in heauen; vvith this only difference, that the ſame beatifying obiect vvhich is novv obſcurely ſeene by faith, and imperfectly embraced by loue, shall herafter be ſeene clearly and perfectly enioyed: The primary and moſt generall Duty required in ſoules vvhich by Gods vocation doe vvalke in the vvaies of the ſpirit, is to admire, loue, and long after this vnion, and to fixe an immoueable reſolution through Gods grace &amp; aſſiſtance to attempt and perſeuere in the proſecution of ſo glorious a deſigne indespight of all oppoſition, through light &amp; darknes, through conſolations &amp; deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48407:39"/> &amp;c. as eſteeming it to be cheaply purchaſed though with the loſſe of all comforts that Nature can find or expect in Creatures.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The fixing of ſuch a couragious Reſolution is of so maine importance &amp; neceſſity, that if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to faile or yeild to any, though the feirceſt tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that may occurre, and are to be expected, ſo as not to be reaſſumed, the whole deſigne will be ruined.

                        <p n="3">3. It is not to be eſteemed loftines, preſumption, or pride to tend to ſo ſublime an end: but it is a good and laudable ambition, and moſt acceptable to God: Yea the Roote of it is true ſolide humility ioynd with the loue of God: For it proceedes from a vile eſteeme and ſome degrees of a holy hatred of our ſelues, from whom vve deſire to fly; and a iuſt eſteeme, obedience, and loue of God, to vvhom only vve deſire to adhere &amp; be inſeparably vnited.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Happy therefore is the ſoule that finds in herſelfe an habituall thirſt &amp; longing after this vnion, if she vvill ſeeke to aſſvvage it by continuall approaches to this Fountaine of liuing vvaters, labouring therto vvith dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Externall &amp; Internall vvorkings. The very tendance to this vnion, in vvhich our vvhole Eſſentiall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes conſiſts, has in it ſome degrees of happines, and is an imperfect vnion, diſpoſing to a perfect one. For by

And that vvith out ſuch an interiour tendance &amp; deſire no exteriour ſuffrances or obſeruances vvill imprint any true vertue in the ſoule, or bring her neerer to God, vvee ſee in the example of <hi>Suſo,</hi> vvho for the firſt fiue yeares of a Religious Profeſſion found no ſatisfaction in ſoule at all notvvthſtanding all his care &amp; exactnes in exteriour Regular Obſeruances and mortifications: he perceiued plainly that ſtill he vvanted ſome thing, but vvhat that vvas he could not tell: till God vvas pleaſed to diſcouer it to him, and put him in the vvay to atteine to his deſire, vvhich vvas in ſpirit to tend continually to this vnion; vvith out vvhich all his auſterities and Obſeruances ſerued little or nothing, as proceeding principally from ſelfe loue, ſelfe-iudgment &amp; the ſatisfying of Nature euen by croſſing it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let nothing therfore deterre a vvelminded ſoule from perſeuering vvith feruour in this firme reſolution.

The vvant of a due knovvledge or conſideration herof is the cauſe that ſome good ſoules after they haue made ſome progreſſe in Internall vvaies, become dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned, and in danger to ſtop or quite leaue them. For though at the firſt, being (as vſually they are) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by God vvith a tender ſenſible deuotion (vvhich <hi>our Holy Father</hi> calls <hi>feruorem Nouitium</hi>) they doe vvith much zeale &amp; as it ſeemes to them, vvith good effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the exerciſes of mortification &amp; praier: Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard ſuch ſenſible feruour &amp; tendernes ceaſing (as it ſeldome failes to doe) by that nevv light vvhich they haue gotten, they diſcerne a vvorld of defects, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vndiſcouered, vvhich they erroneously thinke vvere not in them before: vvherupon fearing that inſtead of making progreſſe, they are in a vvorſe ſtate then vvhen they begun, they vvill be apt to ſuſpect that they are in a vvrong vvay. This proceeds from a preconceiued miſtake, that becauſe in times of light &amp; deuotion the ſoule finds her ſelfe caried vvith much feruour to God, and perceiues but ſmall contradictions and rebellions in inferiour Nature, that therfore she is very forvvard in the vvay to Perfection. Wheras it is far othervviſe. For Nature is not ſo eaſily conquered as she imagins, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the vvay to Perfection ſo eaſy and short. Many changes she muſt expect: many riſings and fallings: ſome times light, and ſome times Darknes: ſometimes calmnes of Paſſions, and preſently after, it may be, feircer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats then before: and theſe ſucceſſions of changes repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God knovves hovv oft, before the End approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>

Yea it vvill likelie happen to ſuch Soules, that euen the formerly vvell knovven, groſſer defects in them vvill ſeeme to encreaſe and to grovv more hard to be quelld after they haue bene competently aduanced in Internall vvaies. And the reaſon is, becauſe hauing ſett themſelues to combat corrupt Nature in all her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, crooked &amp; impure deſires, and being ſequeſtred from the vanities of the vvorld, they find themſelues in continuall vvreſtlings and agonies, and vvant thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diuerſions, conuerſations &amp; recreations vvith vvhich vvhilſt they liued a ſecular, negligent life they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt or putt of their melancholick thoughts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes.

                        <p n="10">10. Novv as from the conſideration of the tediouſnes of a perfect vniuerſall mortification of the corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Nature, it does appeare that Haſty Perfection is not ordinarily to be expected. And vvhere there are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of extraordinary lights &amp; ſupernaturall viſits in ſoules not throughly mortified, it is to be feared that there hath bene ſome ſecret exorbitancy in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſuch ſoules, ſome deeply rooted Pride &amp;c. vvhich hath expoſed them to the Deuills Illuſions, ſo that then ſtate is very dangerous.

                        <p n="12">12. Vpon theſe grounds Myſtick Authours doe teach; that though it be a very great aduantage to a ſoule to treade in theſe Internall vvaies from her Youth, before she be darkned and made ſicke vvith vicious Habits, the combatting againſt vvhich vvill cauſe great difficulty, paine and tediouſnes to her: Yet she vvill hardly arriue vnto the foreſaid Actiue vnion and experimentall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Gods Preſence in her till almoſt a declining Age: by reaſon that though her Naturall ill inclinations may be mortified in a reaſonable Perfection before that time: Yet till ſuch Age there vvill remaine too much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in Corporall Nature, and an vnſtablenes in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard ſenſes, vvhich vvill hinder that Quietnes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſednes of mind neceſſary to ſuch an Vnion.

                        <p n="13">13. Now what hath bene ſaid concerning the length of the vvay, and the multiplicity of conditions requiſite to the atteining to the End of it, is to be vnderſtood with relation to the ordinary courſe of Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But God vvho is the free Maiſter and diſpoſer of his ovvne Graces, may beſtovv them vpon vvhom &amp; vvhen he pleaſes, either Miraculouſly encreaſing his Grace in ſome Soules, or conferring his ſupernaturall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours before the time that they are ripe for them: As he did to <hi>S.

                        <p n="14">14. But be the vvay to Perfection neuer ſo long, the deſigne it ſelfe is ſo Noble and the end ſo Diuine, that a ſoule can not begin to aſpire vnto it too ſoone, nor take too much paines to procure it. Yea the very deſire and ſerious purſuance of ſo heauenly a deſigne brings ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48407:43"/> great Bleſſings to the Soule, and puts her in ſo ſecure a way of Saluation, though she should neuer perfectly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vnto it in this life, that there is none ſo old, nor ſo ouer growen with ill Habits, but ought to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, &amp; with perſeuerance purſue it, being aſſured that at leaſt after Death he shall for his good deſire and endeauours be revvarded vvith the crovvne due to Contemplatiues.

Though the truth is, the ſoule being a pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit conſiſting of mere Actiuity, cannot ceaſe doing and deſiring ſome thing: ſo that if her deſires &amp; operations be not directed to the right End, they vvill goe a vvrong vvay; and if a Soule doe not continually ſtriue to get out of Nature, she vvill plunge her ſelfe deeper &amp; dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into it.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. The ſecond Motiue to induce a ſoule to arme herſelfe vvith a great courage and ſtrong Reſolution in her tendance to Perfection is, becauſe as the Wiſe man ſays, <hi>He that ſets himſelfe to ſerue our Lord</hi> (eſpecially in ſo high and diuine an employment as Contemplation) <hi>must prepare his ſoule for Tentations,</hi> greater and more

                        <p n="16">16. For an Internall life being not only a life hidden from the vvorld, but likevviſe directly contrary to the vvaies of carnall rerſon, yea euen different from the common notion of vertue and Piety vvhich ordinary Chriſtians, yea too many euen in Religion haue alſo, vvho approue only of Actions and vvaies vvhich out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardly make a faire shevv, as ſolemne performance of Diuine Offices, externall formall Regularities, mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations &amp;c.

A ſoule that comes out of the world to a religious Contemplatiue life; or that liuing yet in the vvorld, is abſtracted from the vvorld, &amp; aſpires to a ſtate of Perfection, at the firſt ordinarily vvill ſtand in need of an <hi>Externall Instructour</hi> &amp; guide for moſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concerne her in that vvay. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſuch ſoules, although being ſuppoſed to be in the ſtate Grace, they haue ſufficient Internall light to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the ordinary Duties of a Chriſtian life, for the auoyding of ſin, &amp; performing the neceſſary Acts of vertues requiſite: yet as to the proper practiſes of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vvaies, &amp; to the ordering of common Actions to the aduancing of themſelues tovvards Contemplation they are indeed <hi>penitùs animales,</hi> gouerned by ſenſe &amp; the obſcure deceitfull light of naturall reaſon, ſcarſe knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvhat an <hi>Internall Inſpiration,</hi> (vvith regard to ſuch matters,) is: &amp; hovveuer very much diſabled are they to diſcerne or correſpond to ſuch an Inſpiration.

Yet euen this ſeeking &amp; ſubmitting themſelues vnto Externall directours is not to be eſteemed merely an Act of nature, or guided only by a naturall light; but of ſuch Inſpirations &amp; ſupernaturall light vvhich atte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="2">2.

In vvhich caſe it is indeed their <hi>Diuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Maister</hi> that they obey, vvho ſpeakes vnto them by the externall Directour appoynted vnto them by God.

                        <p n="3">3. Novv to the end to enable the ſoule to make a good choyce (I meane ſuch a ſoule as hath freedome to make her ovvne choice) I vvill ſet dovvne the <hi>Qualities ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary to be found in a good Directour:</hi> by vvhich <hi>title,</hi> I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48407:60"/> doe not meane ſimply a <hi>Confeſsarius,</hi> that is only to heare faults confeſſed, to giue Abſolution, &amp; there an end: for the ordinary Qualities of learning &amp; prudence are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficien therto. But by a <hi>ſpirituall Directour</hi> I intend one that beſides this, is to inſtruct the Diſciple in all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar duties of an Internall life; that is to iudge of her propenſion to contemplatiue vvayes; &amp; that can at leaſt teach her hovv she may fitt herſelfe vvith a degree of Prayer proper for her; that knovves all the degrees of Internall prayer, &amp; can determine hovv long she is to remaine in ſuch a degree, &amp; vvhen to change it for an higher; That can iudge vvhat employments &amp;c. are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or hindring to her progres in Internall vvayes: But eſpecially that can teach her hovv to diſpoſe herſelfe to hearken to &amp; follovv Gods Internall teaching, &amp; to ſtand in no more need of conſulting her Externall Directour &amp;c. Such are the proper offices of a guide; to enable him vvhereto, there are generally by Spirituall vvriters requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three principall Qualities, 1. <hi>a good naturall Iudgment.</hi> 2. <hi>Learning.</hi> 3. <hi>Experience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. But becauſe it is ſcarſe to be hoped for in all places &amp; for all ſoules to find a Directour abſolutly perfect &amp; Qualified vvith all manner of fitting conditions; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Writers doe diſpute vvhat quality is the moſt neceſſary to make a Directour capable of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient discharge of his office. Novv for as much as concernes the firſt condition, to vvit, a <hi>good naturall Iudgment,</hi> though by all it be acknovvledged to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient alone, yet is it ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that without it no conſiderable experience can be atteined; &amp;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48407:61"/> Learning if it be ioyned vvith an extrauagant capricious ſpirit, vvill proue rather pernicious then aduantageous; Therfore the <hi>Queſtion</hi> remaines betvveene <hi>Learning &amp; experience,</hi> vvhether of the tvvo is the more neceſſary?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But truly this ſcarce deſerues to be a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For though for the aſſoyling of ordinary Doubts &amp; caſes of conſcience, as about faſting, ſaying the Diuine office, Confeſſion, Reſtitution &amp;c: learning be the principall condition to be looked after in one that is to be a Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for ſuch purpoſes: Notvvthſtanding ſince the Office of the ſpirituall Directour, that novv vve ſeeke after, is to be exerciſed in ſuch Internall matters of the ſpirit, as hath bene ſaid, to vvit, <hi>Contemplatiue prayer, Attending to diuine Inſpirations</hi> &amp;c: it is the reſolute iudgment of <hi>Gerſon, Auila, S. Tereſa, B. Iohn de Cruce, Seraphinus Firmanus</hi> &amp;c: that no truſt is to be giuen to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vvithout experience, but much to experience though vvithout learning. And to this purpoſe it is obſeruable, that for the moſt part the Inſtruments that God hath bene pleaſed both in ancient &amp; moderne times to employ in the Inſtructing &amp; guiding of ſoules to the perfection of contemplatiue Prayer, haue bene perſons of ſmall learning but great experience, ſuch as vvere <hi>S. Anthony, S. Benedict, S. Francis, S. Tereſa &amp;c:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. No learning therfore that may be got by ſtudy &amp; reading, though of all the contemplatiue bookes that novv are extant, will alone ſerue to enable any one to be a competent Directour for Internall liuers. But there is neceſſary Experience &amp; practiſe in the ſame Prayer, &amp; other internall Exerciſes that are to be taught: for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48407:61"/> neuer ſo many yeares ſpent in diſcourſiue Prayer, vvill little auayle to qualify any perſon to become a proper &amp; proffitable <hi>Directour</hi> for ſoules that tend to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, as all incloſed Religious men &amp; vvoemen are obliged to doe.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Yea it is much more ſafe for a vvell-meaning ſoule to truſt to her ovvne internall light though obſcure; &amp; to ſuch Inſtructions as bookes vvhich treate of ſuch kind of Prayer, vvill afford her, or elſe to the guidance of a vertuous humble-minded Directour, (vvho though he haue but a very ſmall Proportion either of Experience or learning, yet out of humility vvill not aſſume vnto himſelfe Authority to iudge of things aboue his reach, but vvill incourage the ſoule either to ſeeke out one more intelligent, or to follovv the directions of her ovvne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit illuminated by grace) then to confide in ſuch dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours as beleiue &amp; vvould faine haue the vvorld doe ſo too, that the <hi>Spirituall Exerciſes</hi> are the moſt perfect kind of Internall prayer, &amp; by conſequence vvhoſe beſt aduiſes vvill be to make her ſuſpect all tracts &amp; inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvhervvith God shall dravv her to a more ſublime, quiet, pure prayer in ſpirit: from vvhich ſuch Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours vvill pluck her dovvne to multiplicity, diſtraction &amp; vnquietnes: the beſt Prayer that they can teach being that vvhich is exerciſed more groſſely in the Imagination, in figuring of ſeenes, poſtures &amp; repreſentations, or by curious painfull Diſcourſes in the vnderſtanding, fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring her likevviſe vvith nice formes &amp; methods in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, both very inſupportable, &amp; alſo vnproffitable, yea pernicious to the deſigne of ſuch ſoules that tend to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48407:62"/> contemplation, though very good &amp; proper for thoſe vvho liue Actiue liues. What orders can ſuch <hi>Directours</hi> giue touching the true vſe of <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> of vvhich there is great varietie? or concerning other ſubtile <hi>pure eleuations, annihilations, or internall, repoſefull ſilent prayers of the ſpirit?</hi> And much leſſe helpe is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them in the caſe of thoſe ſtrange in explicable <hi>Priuatious,</hi> the vvich are of infinite variety, befalling to many ſoules highly aduanced in Contemplation.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. What a miſery therfore is it to ſee Contemplatiue Orders, yea euen thoſe of the greateſt ſolitude &amp; Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life, affording them ſo great aduantages for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, to ſeeke Rules for Contemplatiue prayer from thoſe whoſe profeſſion is ſo abſolutely contrary thereto? And the more that ſuch incompetent <hi>Directours</hi> are practiſed &amp; aduanced in skill about their owne Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, the more vnfit are they to become guides to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue ſpirits, &amp; the more dangerous is it to rely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them: for ſuch Experience ioyned with learning vvill make them confident that their owne way is the very beſt for all, &amp; zealous to draw all others to a liking &amp; admiration of it. Moſt certeine it is, that this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe why not only <hi>the ſpirit of Contemplation,</hi> but euen the knowledge almoſt of it is againe loſt in many <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatiue Orders,</hi> notvvithſtanding ſo fevv yeares are paſt ſince it vvas reuiued by thoſe eminent lights, <hi>S.

                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. I may truly ſay, that neither naturall Indgment, learning, nor experience all together are abſolutly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to qualify a perſon for the employment of guiding

                           <p>§. 11 Why Myſtick Authours ſeeme to write diuerſely.</p>
                           <p>§. 12. Some Authours indiſcreetly require Perfection at first.</p>
                           <p>§. 13. Reading must giue way to Prayer.</p>
                           <p>§. 14, how mortification is to be practiſed in Reading.</p>
                           <p>§. 15. 16. Diuine inſpirations to be obſerued in applying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: And particularly of thoſe in this booke.</p>
                           <p>§. 17. A ſoule following God may without bookes or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours be lead to perfect Contemplation.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. A Second meane by vvhich the Diuine ſpirit teacheth deuout ſoules, is the reading of Pious, bookes. And this exerciſe I eſteeme for vvorth &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall proffit to be next vnto Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for <hi>ordinarly bookes,</hi> as Eccleſiaſticall ſtory &amp;c: it may be permitted to ſoules euen in Religion to read them for an innocent Diuerſion &amp; Recreation, ſo that be not the principall end, but that the Intention further be by ſuch diuerſion to diſpoſe a vveary ſoule the better
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48407:69"/> aftervvards to purſue her internall Exerciſes. And this Permiſſion novv is the more reaſonable, ſince that in Religious communities of men bodily labour is allmoſt out of date, &amp; in place thereof reading &amp; ſtudy hath ſucceeded, as novv the principall dayly Employment of Keligious perſons; vvho liuing much leſſe Abſtracted from the vvorld, are almoſt forced to comply vvith the cuſtomes of the preſent times in vvhich learning is ſo valevved &amp; ſo abounding.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But as for <hi>Spirituall Bookes</hi> the Intention of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall liuer ought not to be ſuch as is that of thoſe vvho liue extrouerted liues, vvho read them out of a vaine curioſity, or to be therby enabled to diſcourſe of ſuch ſublime matters, vvithout any particular choyce or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration vvhether they be ſuitable to their ſpirit for practiſe, or no. A Contemplatiue ſoule in Reading ſuch bookes muſt not ſay, <hi>This is a good booke or paſsage:</hi> But moreouer, <hi>This is vſefull &amp; proper for mee, &amp; by Gods grace I will indeauour to put in execution in due time &amp; place the good inſtructions conteined in it, as far as they are good for mee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. For ſuch ſoules the bookes moſt proper are theſe follovving; <hi>Scala perfectionis</hi> vvritten by <hi>F. Walter Hilton; The Clowd of vnknowing</hi> vvritten by an vnknovvne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; <hi>The ſecret Paths of Diuine loue,</hi> as likevviſe <hi>the Anatomie of the ſoule,</hi> vvritten by <hi>R.

And of the Ancients, <hi>the Liues of the Ancient Fathers</hi> liuing in the Deſerts, &amp; <hi>Caſſian his Conferences</hi> of certaine Ancient Hermites (recommended particularly vnto vs by <hi>our Holy Father) S. Baſiles Rules</hi> &amp;c. Then for ſoules that tend to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in an Actiue life, Bookes moſt proper are, The vvorkes of <hi>Rodriguez of perfection;</hi> The <hi>duke of Gandy Of good workes, Monſ. de Sales, Ludouicus de Puente</hi> &amp;c. And laſtly bookes of a mixed nature are <hi>Granatenſis, Bloſius</hi> &amp;c. Indeed fevv ſpirituall bookes there are, vvherin there is not an intermingling of ſuch Inſtructions. Novv I should aduiſe ſoules in an <hi>Actiue life</hi> not at all to meddle vvith Inſtructions belonging to <hi>Contemplation,</hi> but apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues to the precepts &amp; exerciſes of an <hi>Actiue life,</hi> to vſe them in Order to the end therof, the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of externall Chriſtian Charity.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In all ſpirituall bookes, as likevviſe in all that treate of Chriſtian morality, ſuch Inſtructions as concerne the eſſentiall Qualities &amp; Practiſe of vertues, are to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med proper to all ſoules, yet not ſo the motiues, manner &amp; circumſtances of exerciſing the ſaid vertues.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In reading of ſpirituall bookes, if any thing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching prayer &amp;c: occurre (as oftimes it vvill happen) that the ſpirituall diſciple vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not, let him paſſe it ouer, &amp; neither vnneceſſarily trouble his ovvne braines, nor make it a buſines to trouble others about the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of it. Perhaps in time, after more reading, &amp; eſpecially more experience in prayer, he vvill come to vnderſtand it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And as for thoſe things vvhich he either does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48407:70"/> or thinks he vnderſtands them, let him not be haſty to apply them to himſelfe by practiſe, out of his ovvne naturall iudgment or liking; but let him obſerue his ovvne ſpirit, vvay &amp; internall guidance by God, &amp; accordingly make vſe of them: Othervviſe inſtead of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping benefit, ſuch inconueniences may happen, that it vvould haue bene better he had neuer read, nor bene able to read any bookes at all, but only to haue follovved <hi>his owne Internall light,</hi> as many good ſoules haue done that neuer could read, &amp; yet ſeeking God in ſimplicity of their hearts, &amp; praying vvithout any preſcribed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, practiſing likevviſe according to the inuitation &amp; impulſe of the Diuine ſpirit, haue atteined to Perfect Contemplation.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Generally Myſtick Authours vvrite according to their ovvne experience in their ovvne ſoules, vvhen they treate of the ſeuerall degrees of Prayer, &amp; the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manners of diuine operations in ſoules in ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; as if the ſame Inſtructions vvould ſerue indefinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all others. Wheras ſuch is the in explicable variety of internall diſpoſitions, that the ſame courſe &amp; order in all things vvill ſcarſe ſerue any tvvo ſoules. Therefore if the indiſcreet Readers vvithout conſidering their ovvne ſpirits &amp; enablements, shall vpon the Authority of any booke, either tarry too long in an Inferiour degree of Prayer, vvhen God has fitted them, &amp; does call them to a higher; or in a foolish Ambition shall being vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, preſume to a degree of prayer too ſublime &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall for them, there vvill be no end of difficulties, doubts &amp; conſultations.</p>

                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48407:70"/>9. But of all errours the greateſt &amp; moſt dangerous is <hi>the indiſcreet imitating the examples &amp; practiſes of Saints in particular, extraordinary corporall mortifications, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (yet by Gods ſpeciall Direction) aſſumed by them,</hi> as <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, faſtings, watchings, diſciplines &amp;c:</hi> for ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardnes in others, not called therto, to be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likevviſe, it is much to be feared, proceedes merely from Pride &amp; ſelfe-loue, &amp; vvill produce no better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects then the nourishing of the ſame inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And if ſuch haue not the courage &amp; patience (as it cannot be expected they should haue) to perſeuere in ſuch exerciſes, this vvill cauſe Infirmity of body, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="10">10. The benefit that vve ought, &amp; eaſily may reape from the reading of ſuch extraordinary practiſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is to admire Gods vvaies in the conducting of his Saints, &amp; to take occaſion from thence of humbling &amp; deſpiſing of our ſelues, ſeeing hovv short vve come of them in the practiſe of their vertues: But no further to imitate them in ſuch things, then vve may be aſſured that God directs vs by a ſupernaturall light, &amp; enables vs by an extraordinary Grace, yea &amp; moreouer till vve haue obteined the leaue &amp; approbation of a prudent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour. Till this be, let vs ſupply vvith a good vvill vvhat our forces vvill not reach vnto. And aboue all things vvee muſt take heed that vve doe not entangle our ſelues by laying obligations or <hi>vowes</hi> vpon our ſoules about ſuch matters, the vvhich vve shall haue difficulty to diſcharge our ſelues from, vvhen by triall vve find the inconuenience.</p>
                        <p n="11">
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48407:71"/>11. Myſtick Writers in expreſſing the ſpirituall vvay in vvhich they haue bene lead, doe oft ſeeme to differ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly from one another: The vvhich difference not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſtanding if rightly vnderſtood, is merely in the phraſe &amp; manner of expreſſion. And the ground herof is, becauſe the <hi>pure immateriall Operations</hi> of perfect ſoules in prayer, &amp; eſpecially the operations of God in ſoules in vvhich they are patients only, are ſo ſublime, that intelligible vvords &amp; phraſes cannot perfectly expreſſe them; &amp; therfore they are forced to inuent nevv vvords the beſt they can, or to borrovv ſimilitudes from corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things &amp;c. to make their conceptions more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible: &amp; thus does each one according to the manner that he finds or conceiues in himſelfe, or according to his skill in language. No vvonder therfore if there ſeeme to be diuerſity among them. Hervpon the <hi>Authour of the Clowd obſerues,</hi> That great harme may come by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding things litterally, groſſely &amp; ſenſibly, vvhich hovvſoeuer they be expreſſed, vvere intended &amp; ought to be vnderſtood ſpiritually.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Some good ſpirituall Authours intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend certeine Duties neceſſary to be practiſed, for as much as concernes the ſubſtance of the Duties (as an entire ſelfe-abnegation, Purity of intention &amp;c.) they doe vrge the ſaid duties in the greateſt perfection vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, &amp; vvith ſuch phraſes of abſolute neceſſity, as if vpon any defect in practiſing that vertue (ſo by them extended to the full, to the end to preuent all the moſt ſecret vvayes &amp; shifts in vvhich nature is apt to ſeeke her ovvne ſatisfaction) all the vvhole deſigne of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48407:71"/> an Internall life vvere ruined; they doe by this ouermuch exactnes &amp; care, inſtead of exciting the courage of their Readers to the ſerious practiſe of ſo neceſſary a Duty, quite dishearten them; yea perhaps they make them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſtate of their ſoules, vvho being conſcious of their preſent infirmity &amp; imperfections, looſe all heart to aduenture vpon an attempt ſo vnproportionable to their vveake abilities. Wheras if Inſtructions had bene tempered vvith regard to the capacity of each practiſer, they vvould haue gone on vvith courage &amp; good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Voluntary Reading muſt giue place to Prayer, vvhenſoeuer the ſoule finds herſelfe inuited therto.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. The vertue of <hi>Mortification</hi> may, &amp; ſometimes ought to be practiſed in Reading in this manner. When any booke or ſubiect is very guſtfull to a ſoule, she muſt be vvatchfull ouer herſelfe not to povvre herſelfe vvhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon it vvith an intemperate greedines, nor to let cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity or delight too much poſſeſſe her, but let her novv &amp; then ſtop the purſuit of reading, lifting vp her mind by interruptions to God, &amp; afterwards continue at leaſt in a vertuall attention to him, ſo mortifying &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the impetuoſity of nature. And by no meanes let her giue way to an vnwillingnes to quitt Reading for performing her appoynted Recollections, or other exerciſes of obligation.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. To conclude, whoſoeuer in Reading &amp;c. doth not cheifly obſerue his owne ſpirit &amp; Diuine Call, &amp; makes not the bookes, ſayings &amp; examples of others to ſerue the ſaid ſpirit &amp; Call; but on the contrary makes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48407:72"/> the diuine Inſpirations ſubiect to bookes &amp;c: it were better for him neuer to read ſuch bookes, or receiue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtructions; but that he should cleaue only to God, who in caſe of neceſſity vvill moſt aſſuredly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all other wants &amp; defects.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. And the ſame <hi>Liberty</hi> that I haue recommended to ſoules in the Reading of other bookes, I aduiſe them to vſe in theſe inſtructions alſo, that is, to apply to their owne practiſe only ſuch Directions, as their ſpirituall Inſtructour, and their owne experience &amp; reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Grace shall shevv them to be proper for them. Indeed in all this booke I knovv ſcarſe any one Aduice vvhich I can confidently ſay to be properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to all ſoules that leade an Internall life generally, except this; <hi>That they who aſpire to perfection in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation muſt not content themſelues, nor reſt finally in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree of Prayer, but following the Diuine light &amp; inuitation (without obliging themſelues to any formes or methods) they must from the lowest degree of Internall Prayer (which is ordinarily Meditation) proceed to a more ſublime Prayer of immediate Affections &amp; Acts of the will; &amp; from thence aſcend to the Infuſed Prayer of Aſpirations.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. Novv in this laſt paſſage there is a <hi>Document</hi> that vvell deſerues to be conſidered. <hi>Euery one,</hi> ſaith he, in S. Paules vvords, <hi>hath his proper peculiar gift,</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Refection. All good Chriſtians haue the gift to auoyd therein a mortally ſinfull exceſſe: But Religious Internall liuers haue, moreouer (or may haue) <hi>a ſpeciall Gift</hi> to auoyd euen veniall defects; And the Perfect to aduance themſelues therby tovvards Perfection. Yet from thence vve cannot conclude that God has obliged himſelfe to diſcouer vnto euery one, although ſeeking it by Prayer, the exactly true ſtate &amp; complexion of his body. Whence it follovvs that if he, being miſtaken in that vvhich he is not bound to knovv, should demand more or leſſe ſuſtenance then is abſolutly neceſſary; it is no ſin, vpon ſuppoſition that ſuch deſire did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48407:75"/> from a ſenſuall affection to meate, nor a faulty ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of health, but from the beſt light that reaſon could afford him to iudge of his ovvne neceſſity, &amp; from an Intention to benefit his ſoule by a moderate refreshing of nature. And it is Gods vvill that vve should follovv <hi>Reaſon</hi> in all externall things, in vvhich God doth not vſually othervviſe illuminate his ſeruants. Though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Reaſon therfore may faile &amp; be miſtaken, yet the perſon does not offend, but rather follovves God by follovving the light of his reaſon, this being all the light in ſuch caſes afforded him. So for example, if an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite being infirme, and hauing none to conſult vvith, should doubt vvhether it vvere vnlavvfull for him to breake a commanded Faſt: and hauing by Prayer deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods Direction, should remaine perſvvaded thet it vvas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therby should preiudice his health by faſting; This vvould be no ſin at all in him: yea on the contrary it vvould be meritorious: For he vvould faile indeed in that for vvhich he had no light, neither vvas light ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to him, to vvit, the exact knovvledge of vvhat had bene requiſite for corporall health: But he vvould merit in that for vvhich he had light, to vvit, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his ſoule. And ordinarily ſpeaking, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations that God affords to the more perfect in ſuch caſes, are rather to abſteine euen from the more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient commodities, yea oftimes to ſome preiudice of health, for the greater good of the ſoule; becauſe too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious a ſollicitude for health is vnbecoming an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall liuer. Yea a robuſtious health vninterrupted is not conuenient for ſuch an one. But leauing this digreſſion.</p>

But vvithall his ordinations are ſuch, as vve may ſee his Intention and only deſigne vvas by them to diſpoſe ſoules to be capable of obſeruing &amp; follovving the inſpirations &amp; invvard inſtructions of Gods holy Spirit, vvithout vvhich all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Obſeruances vvould neuer bring vs to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:

And vvithall in ſeuerall places of his Rule he ſignifies by the vvay that the Reformation of the Spirit ought to be the principall aime of a Religious Soule. So that in the concluſion of the Rule hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Externall Obſeruances expreſſely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therin (as a preparation to the Perfection to be learnt out of the Liues and Conferences of the Fathers) he profeſſeth with great humility, but vvith great truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>that his intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therby vvas that thoſe vvhich obſerued it be enabled to declare in ſome ſort (honestatem morum, aut initium conuerſationis eos habere) that they had atteined to a laudable exteriour cariage &amp; the beginning of a holy Religious conuerſation: But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whoſoeuer shall tend to perfection: Sunt doctrinae Sanctorum Patrum:</hi> as if he had ſayd, <hi>He muſt according to the teachings of the Holy Fathers attend vnto the Diuine Maister</hi> by exerciſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſtructions that pure ſublime Prayer &amp;c. vvhich they practiſed &amp; diſcouered.

THE Neceſſity of a Diuine Internall Teacher being eſtablished, there follovves from thence an Equall neceſſity for all thoſe, vvhoſe profeſſion obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them to vvalke in thoſe vvayes tovvards the ſublime end propoſed, to attend vnto &amp; obey this only, moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Maiſter.

And this is done by thoſe vvho obſtinatly adhere to preconceiu d

For though ſuch couſtumes in themſelues and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoules may be neuer ſo good &amp; proffitable; yea though formerly euen to thoſe perſons themſelues they haue bene neuer ſo proper &amp; beneficiall; yet this vvas only vvhilſt they vvere in ſuch a ſtate &amp; degree of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality; the vvhich ſtate altering (as in progreſſe it needs muſt) then that vvhich vvas formerly proper &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Diuine vvill &amp; inſpiration, vvill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come improper, inconuenient &amp; contrary to the preſent Internall Guidance of God.</p>
                        <p n="7">7.

                        <p n="8">8.

                        <p n="9">9. This Inſtruction reaches very far; yea ſo far that euen Learned men, yea ſome that paſſe for ſpirituall, if they be vnexperienced in the true Internall vvayes of Gods Spirit leading to Contemplation, vvould perhaps miſlike the freedome vvhich in many caſes muſt, &amp; hath bene allovved by the beſt &amp; moſt ſublime Myſtick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours to ſoules of ſome peculiar diſpoſitions &amp; in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

                        <p n="11">11: Hitherto it may ſuffiſe to haue ſpoken of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments by vvhich ſoules are hindred from attending to &amp; obeying their <hi>Internall Diuine Teacher,</hi> vvho only knowes what is beſt for euery one in all circumſtances, &amp; vvill not faile to direct for the very beſt euery ſoule that with humility and Reſignation hath recourſe to him.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Now ſuch is the nature of the Reaſonable ſoule (which is all Actiuity, &amp; will be continually thinking on &amp; louing ſomewhat) that if theſe impediments, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE <hi>third Point</hi> before propoſed for our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this matter of Internall Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is, <hi>the manner</hi> hovv God communicates his light &amp; grace to our vnderſtanding &amp; vvills for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; Directions, in the Myſtick vvayes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Novv for a clearer explication of this poynt vve are to conſider that that <hi>fundamentall grace,</hi> vvhich in Scriptures is called <hi>Donum ſpiritus ſancti. The Gift of the Holy Ghost, &amp; which</hi> is conferred on all in Baptiſme, &amp; being aftervvard by actuall ſins ſmothered or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, is renevved by Pennance, Prayer &amp;c: &amp; che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48407:82"/> or increaſed by the vvorthy vſe of the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt &amp; other vertuous practiſes of a Chriſtian life: This <hi>Grace,</hi> I ſay, (vvhat euer it be <hi>Phyſically</hi> in its ovvne nature, if it vvere examined Scholaſtically, vvhich is not my intent) is a certaine Diuine Principle <hi>or Faculty,</hi> partaking ſomevvhat of the nature of <hi>a permanent habit,</hi> infuſed into the ſpirit of man, by vvhich he is enabled, vvhenſoeuer the free vvill concurreth actually, both for knovving, beleiuing &amp; practiſing to doe the vvill of God in all things. For the vertue thereof extends it ſelfe through all the faculties of the ſoule, curing the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, vvants, &amp; deordinations that ſin had cauſed in them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This nevv <hi>Diuine faculty</hi> therfore (vvhich ſeemes to be expreſſed by the Prophet Dauid, vvhen he ſaith, <hi>ſignatum est ſuper nos lumen vultus tui Domine,</hi> That is. <hi>The light of thy countenance, O lord, is like a ſeale ſtamped on our ſoules</hi>) doth not, neither is it ſufficient of it ſelfe alone actually to produce any ſauing effects: As vve ſee that a Muſician or a Poet though neuer ſo skillfull, doe not therfore euer actually ſing or vvrite verſes, vntill ſome certaine occaſions or circumſtances doe actually determine them therto, as gaine, or requeſts of others, or praiſe, or a mind to pleaſe themſelues &amp;c: For the Actuall employment &amp; exerciſe of ſuch Grace there is moreouer neceſſary an <hi>actuall ayde</hi> from God, vvho by a ſpeciall Diuine Prouidence doth often adminiſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, hints &amp; enablements exciting the vvill to vvaken this <hi>Grace</hi> in the ſoule, vvhich othervviſe vvould lye vacant &amp; vnuſefull.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:48407:82"/>4. And proofes of this, dayly experience shevves vs both in our ſelues &amp; others, hovv a ſermon or any other vvord ſeaſonably ſpoken, or any obiect occurring vvith due circumſtances doth incite vs to lift vp our ſoules to God by prayer, to performe ſome Acts of Charity, to mortify ſome inordinate affection &amp;c. Yea ſometimes from a deſperate ſinfull ſtate to conuert our ſoules to God. And thus doing vve (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> exhorts Timothy, doe <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) raiſe &amp; <hi>blow into a flame</hi> the grace vvhich before lay in our hearts, like coales of fire smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred in the Ashes. And if this be frequently done, that Grace vvhich at the first imparting vvas but vveake, &amp; needed ſtrong endeauours to excite it, becomes far more actiue, &amp; more eaſy to be excited, ſo that vpon any the leaſt occaſion offred, it is ready to beſtirre it ſelfe &amp; diſperſe its odours &amp; vertue; till at laſt it gets ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a dominion in perfect ſoules, that it quite ſubdues the <hi>contrary Principle</hi> of corrupt nature: And is ſcarſe euer idle, but the leaſt hint being giuen, it turnes the ſoule preſently to God, &amp; keepes it almoſt continually fixed on him: In ſo much as thoſe things which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had no effect at all vpon them, now preſently &amp; euen violently inflame them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Yea in ſome ſupereminently perfect ſoules this gift of Gods holy Spirit comes to be ſo vigorous, that it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues euen reaſon it ſelfe, &amp; leades it captiue after it ſelfe, pushing the ſoule to <hi>Heroycall actions</hi> vvithout any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Act of reaſon, or the leaſt deliberation; though in the Act the ſoule by conſenting, merits. Thus vve reade of the ancient Martyrs hovv they by an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48407:83"/> impulſe of the Diuine ſpirit, rushed before the perſecuting Iudges to confeſſe the name of Chriſt. Yea S. Apollonia caſt herſelfe into the fire: <hi>The loue of Chriſt</hi> burning in their hearts &amp; <hi>constreining them,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayes: From the like efficacy of the Diuine ſpirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that Spirituall Gift of Prayer, by vvhich the Holy Primitiue Chriſtians in their Publicke meetings conceiued &amp; povvred forth Prayers vvithout any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence therto of their ovvne Inuention, <hi>Gods ſpirit it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> (in <hi>S.

                        <p n="6">6. <hi>This fundamentall Grace</hi> therfore is that <hi>Talent</hi> or ſtock, that has Gods Image on it, &amp; not Caeſars, vvhich <hi>God beſtowes vpon</hi> euery one in Baptiſme &amp;c. <hi>to trade</hi> vvith all: the vvhich till the vvill cooperates vvith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Ayde of God, is, as it vvere, <hi>wrapped in a Napkin &amp; hid vnder ground;</hi> but being vvell managed <hi>multiplies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many Talents.</hi> This is that very ſmall but <hi>Diuine ſeed</hi> of vvhich <hi>the Euangeliſt ſpeakes,</hi> vvhich being caſt in our hearts, by labour &amp; cultiuation produces many &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruits: this is that <hi>(Fermentum) leauen,</hi> vvhich being <hi>incloſed</hi> in the three faculties of our ſoules, as <hi>in three mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of meale,</hi> doth diſperſe its vertue through the whole maſſe.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Novv to the end I may approach more cloſe to the preſent matter: vve may further conſider, that as by the exerciſe of Morall Philoſophicall vertues there is ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48407:83"/> &amp; daily increaſed by perſeuerance in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, that moſt noble vniuerſall vertue of Morall <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> vvhich no ſtudy or ſpeculatiue learning hovv great ſoeuer, could haue produced: The vvhich Prudence as <hi>the Philoſopher</hi> ſayes, is a skill moſt properly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about particular Acts (not generall notions or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of things:) and enlightens the ſoule to iudge &amp; determine in vvhich circumſtances, &amp; vvith vvhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring qualities an Action of vertue ought and may vvith the beſt aduantage and perfection be exerciſed: So that by the helpe of this vertue of <hi>Prudence,</hi> vvhen it is arriued to an excelling degree, a vertuous Perſon will neuer omitt a due occaſion to practiſe vertue, nor vvill he euer doe it vnſeaſonably and vndiſcreetly (for then it vvould not be vertue:) and vvhen he exerciſes it, he vvill not be deficient in any thing requiſite to giue a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter therto. The very ſame in a due proportion is ſeene in the Exerciſe of Diuine vertue or <hi>Charity:</hi> for by a conſtant practiſe therof, not only Charity it ſelfe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, multiplied and increaſed, but there is likevviſe kindled in the ſoule by the ſpirit of God <hi>a light of ſpirituall Prudence</hi> far more cleare and more certaine to conduct vs in the Diuine vvayes, then morall Prudence is in the waies of morall honeſty. The vvhich Diuine light has this great aduantage aboue Prudence, That wheras <hi>Morall wiſedome</hi> can only teach the exerciſe of vertue in thoſe occaſions (which doe not euery day happen) in which ſuch vertues ought to be exerciſed, neglecting to giue any Rules to leſſer indifferent Actions: <hi>This Diuine light</hi> vvhich teaches vs to loue nothing at all but God, accounts
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48407:84"/> no actions at all in particular indifferent, but teaches vs to direct all to the ſeruice and loue of God, and can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne hovv one may concurre therto more then another, and accordingly chuſes the beſt.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Novv <hi>the Reaſon why</hi> by <hi>the Exerciſe</hi> of Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (and not by any ſtudy or ſpeculatiue conſiderations) this Diuine light can be kindled is, becauſe the Blindnes and Darknes vvhich is naturally in our vnderſtandings comes principally from the peruerſe deordination vvhich Selfe-loue cauſes in our vvills: By meanes of vvhich vve vvill not ſuffer the vnderſtanding to ſee vvhat it does ſee: For euen vvhen by the light of Faith vve are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall inſtructed in the Offices and Rules of vertue and Piety, yet in many particulars Selfe-loue adhering to that ſide vvhich vve ought to refuſe, vvill either forbid and hinder the vnderſtanding from conſidering vvhat is euill or defectuous in it: or if there be any the leaſt ground of Doubt, it vvill caſt ſuch faire gloſſes on it, and ſo ſeduce the vnderſtanding to find out Motiues and pretences for the preferring therof, that in fine the light it ſelfe vvhich is in the vnderſtanding vvill miſleade vs. But vvhen by perfect <hi>Diuine Charity</hi> all theſe diſtorſions of the vvill are rectified, and that all the ſubtile inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, falſe pretexts, cloſe intereſts and Deſignes of ſelfe-loue are diſcouered and banished, then the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all things vvith a cleare light, and propoſing God as the end of all Actions vvhatſoeuer, it ſees vvhere God is to be found in them; and may beſt be ſerued and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such as are great voluntary auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, performing of ſolemne Offices, almeſ-giuing &amp;c. all vvhich vnleſſe they come from the Principle of true Charity, and are deſigned for the increaſing and deeper rooting therof in the Spirit, are ſo far from being of any vvorth, that they doe rather preiudice and diminish that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48407:85"/> vertue. Both theſe Conditions are requiſite to make an Action perfect and acceptable to God; it muſt both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>from him;</hi> and alſo be directed to <hi>him;</hi> He muſt not only be <hi>the End,</hi> but <hi>the Principle</hi> alſo.

For to perfect ſoules the Diuine voice and light is in a manner a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall guide, and they haue a continuall correſpondence vvith it, euen in their moſt ordinary ſmalleſt actions.

The reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Imagination,</hi> and <hi>Paſsion</hi> being yet very predominant in them, doe push them haſtily to performe their actions, vvithout ſufficient Reflection and conſulting their <hi>Internall Teacher:</hi> And if they doe endeauour to adioyne a good intention, it comes late,

                        <p n="16">16. The beſt meanes therfore that imperfect ſoules haue to cleanſe their ordinary actions from the impurity of naturall intereſts, is in a generall manner to forethinke dayly of their imployments of obligation, and to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordaine the future employments of the day, (I meane ſuch as are left to their ovvne voluntary choyce and iudgment, and that are likely to take up any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of their time and Thoughts, as certaine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Studies &amp;c.) and therupon at their morning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections begging the aſſiſtance of the Diuine ſpirit, let them make good purpoſes to performe them out of the motiue of <hi>Diuine loue,</hi> and for Gods glory: and let them take heed not to change the order reſolued indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly: Yet vvithall on the other ſide, let them auoyd the intangling themſelues vvith any ſuch reſolutions, ſo as that the tranſgreſſing of them should cauſe diſturbance or remorſe in them.

                        <p n="1">1. BVT novv becauſe, as I ſayd, thoſe that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect haue but a dimme light, inſufficient to direct them in many occurrent actions: And thoſe that haue atteined to an Habituall ſupernaturall light of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48407:88"/> doe find that there are many caſes to vvhich their light doth not extend: yea in the moſt perfect it vvill fayle them in ſome: therfore in ſuch a caſe of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, vvherin a vvell-minded ſoule has a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Doubt</hi> about ſome matter of moment, either in the courſe of her Prayer, or in any other thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes an internall life; and that she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not find an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced perſon to vvhom she can confidently propoſe her difficulty, or perhaps has not an interiour inuitation to ſeeke for Reſolution from any one: I vvill endeauour by the beſt light that God has giuen me, to inſtruct ſuch a ſoule hovv she is to behaue herſelfe in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that she may obteine from God <hi>an Actuall Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> or Direction: And then I vvill declare in what manner ſuch light is ordinarily conferred vpon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall liuers.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The matter of the <hi>doubt</hi> is ſuppoſed to be of ſome vveight: for as for ordinary inconſiderable difficulties, she may in the name of God diſpatch them the beſt she can vvith her naturall iudgement, doing vvith a good intention that vvhich it shall dictate to be the beſt, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling herſelfe no further about them: Becauſe it vvould be more preiudice to a ſoule to looſe time, and diſquiet herſelfe vvith a curious and ſollicitous examination of euery ſmall difficulty, then if by determining quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly she should chance to chuſe that vvhich in it ſelfe vvere the leſſe perfect (it being ſuppoſed that ſin lyes on neither ſide of the doubt.)</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Againe ſome caſes there are of ſuch a nature that they are to be reſolued only by an externall Directour
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48407:88"/> or Superiour, ſo that a ſoule ought not, and vvill in vaine expect a Reſolution from God, vvho ſends her to his Subſtitutes. Such are the caſes vvhich concerne exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Obſeruances, as <hi>Fasting, ſaying the Diuine Office, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Rule, Lawes or Conſtitutions</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>office of the Internall Master</hi> is cheifly about internall matters, or the not-doing of externall, vvhich are not of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In ſuch <hi>doubtfull caſes</hi> of moment, eſpecially if they concerne ſomething to be done, or omitted, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred in the future, a deuout ſoule is to auoyd all ſudden and vnaduiſed reſolutions: And this eſpecially vvhilſt she is in any kind of <hi>Paſsion,</hi> vvhether it be <hi>Feare, Anger, Greife, or</hi> elſe of <hi>Tendernes, Compaſsion,</hi> and <hi>kindnes</hi> &amp;c. And cheifly vvhen herſelfe has an intereſt of nature, or vvhen perſons are concerned to vvhom she beares a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible affection, or from vvhom she has an auerſion. In ſuch caſes it is good to deferre the Reſolution as long as vvell may be, to the end that she may haue the more ſpace to conſider of it vvith her naturall reaſon, and to free herſelfe from Paſſion; and ſo vvith Reſignation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult God in her recollections, therby to obteine light from him to diſcerne his holy vvill. And another reaſon and Motiue to deferre the matter may be, becauſe it may happen that before a determinate Reſolution be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſome nevv circumſtances may ſpring &amp; interuene that vvill perhaps alter the ſtate of the difficulty.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In caſe the ſoule in her nature be inclind more to the one ſide of the doubt then the other, she muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force herſelfe, eſpecially in prayer, to an indifferency and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48407:89"/> Reſignation in the matter: rather forethinking (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly preparing herſelfe) that God vvill declare his vvill for the contrary to that to vvhich her nature is more inclined.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In ſeeking to knovv the Diuine vvill by prayer, let not the perſon make the ſubiect and buſines of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection to be the framing a direct Prayer about the matter. Neither let him in his Prayer enterteine any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, debating thoughts in his imagination or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding about it; as if he had an intention to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that to be Gods vvill vvhich by ſuch diſcourſe ſeemed moſt probable. 1. Becauſe by ſuch proceedings our Prayers, vvhich should be pure and internall in ſpirit, vvill be turned into a diſtracting Meditation v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an externall affaire, and ſo the mind comes to be filled vvith ſenſible Images: and Paſſions perhaps vvill be raiſed. 2. Becauſe by ſo doing, vve incurre the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſeduced, by miſtaking our ovvne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or perhaps naturall inclination for the Diuine light and Motion; vvheras ſuch Diuine light is moſt effectually and ſecurely, yea and ſeldome othervviſe obteined then vvhen the imagination is quiet, and the ſoule in a profound recollection in ſpirit. 3. Becauſe ſuch diſcourſing in time of Praier is nothing leſſe then Prayer, being little more then humane conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and examination of the matter, the vvhich, if at all, ought to be diſpatched before Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Let not the ſoule therefore that is deſirous by Prayer to obteine light from God in a doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for that end alter any thing in the order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48407:89"/> of her accuſtomed Recollections; but let her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them as she vvas vvont before. Only it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her ſecretly and breifly to vvish that God vvould teach her his vvill about the ſayd difficulty.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But let her be ſure to take great care she doe not giue vvay to any hope or deſire that God shoud reueile his Will vnto her by any Extraordinary vvay, as by the <hi>Miniſtery of Angells, ſtrange Reuelations, Voices</hi> &amp;c. For as nothing but Pride can ordinarily nourish such foolish hopes or deſires, ſo it is to be feared that if ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires should be granted, it vvould be to her preiudice, and vvould encreaſe that Pride from vvhence they flovved.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Now there are <hi>two Ordinary waies</hi> by vvhich God intimates his vvill to his ſeruants that vvith humble &amp; Reſigned Praiers addreſſe themſelues vnto him. <hi>The first is by clearing of the vnderstanding,</hi> thereto adding a Supernaturall light, by vvhich naturall reaſon comes to ſee ſomething that it ſavv not before, or at leaſt did not eſteeme before ſo conſiderable. For by this nevv light of <hi>Supernaturall Diſcretion</hi> ſuch obſcurities as did before hinder reaſon from diſcerning Truth, are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The vvhich obſcurities are generally cauſed by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Images, vvhich haue prepoſſeſſed themſelues of the Fancie; or by Intereſts of Nature vvhich haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Affections: by both vvhich Reaſon is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated to haſten a iudgment and Election before she haue conſidered maturely, and vvithout partiality all Circumſtances fit to be conſidered in an Action: ſo that Reaſon vvanting this Supernaturall light kindled
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48407:90"/> by Charity determines it ſelfe to chuſe that part to which Paſſion inclines.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Novv ſince there are no meanes ſo efficacious to free the ſoule from both theſe Impediments, as <hi>Pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Praier,</hi> in vvhich the ſoule tranſcends all groſſe ſenſible Images, and vvithall contradicts and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all motions and Intereſts of nature, Wee may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely vpon the light and Dictamen vvhich is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by our vnderſtanding ſo cleared, purified &amp; freed from all noiſe &amp; diſtraction from the ſenſible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Appetite: and this being the beſt and ſafeſt light that man can haue, we may &amp; muſt acknovvledge it to be Supernaturall, becauſe it illuminates vs in Supernaturall things, diſcouering the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveene the preſent Action and our Supernaturall end, and extinguishing the light of Carnall Reaſon, by which the things vvhich are of God are either not ſeene at all, or eſteemed foolishnes: It is therfore to be accepted as the very light of Gods Holy Spirit, a light that cannot be obtained by ſtudy, not inſtilled into another by the moſt ſpirituall perſon in the vvorld. Yea moreouer it is <hi>a light</hi> that exceeds the efficacy of the <hi>ordinary light of Faith</hi> vvhich is permanently in vs, by vvhich vve are only il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated to preceiue in a generall manner ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obiects, and the meanes leading to them: vvheras by this <hi>Lampe</hi> nevvly kindled in our vnderſtandings by Prayer and Charity, vve clearly diſcerne in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Actions and Circumſtances in vvhat manner and hovv far they haue relation and efficacy to diſpoſe vs to a Perfect vnion by loue vvith God.</p>
                        <p n="11">
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48407:90"/>11. If a ſoule before her Recollection hath aduiſed and conſidered of the difficulty, and that aftervvard vpon her Praier she doe find herſelfe inclined to vvhat before she conſulting vvith her ovvne Reaſon or vvith any other Counſellour, had iudged to be the beſt, I should eſteeme it novv to be <hi>a Diuine Inſpiration:</hi> Not for the former debatings ſake, but for the ſubſequent confirmation of it in vertue of Recollection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond way</hi> by vvhich God doth immediatly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his vvill to the Intellectiue ſoule in vertue of Prayer, is, by imprinting <hi>a blind, reaſonles motion into the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour will,</hi> giuing it a vveight and propenſion to one ſide of the Doubt, rather then to the other, vvithout repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting actually and at the preſent to the vnderſtanding any ſpeciall <hi>Motiue</hi> or Reaſon ſufficient to determine the vvill. This alſo coming in vertue of ſpirituall Prayer, may confidently be eſteemed the vvorke of God, ſince no creature can immediatly moue the Superiour vvill.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Pertinently herto vve reade, that the <hi>Holy Abbot Niſteron</hi> (vvho vvas a familiar friend of <hi>S.

                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is ſayd in the tenth Booke of Ariſtotles Ethicks, That a Vertuous man is the meaſure and Rule of humane Actions. 2. By way of Knowledges: as any one that is skilled in Morall ſcience can iudge of the Acts of Vertue, although himſelfe be voyd of vertue. The former way of iudging of Diuine things perteines to Wiſedome, which is affirmed to be a Gift
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48407:91"/> of the Holy Ghoſt, according to that ſaying nf S. Paul</hi> [1. Cor. 21.] <hi>The ſpirituall man iudgeth all things: As likewiſe. S. Denys ſayth in his 2. Chapt. de Div. Nom. Hierotheus is inſtructed, not only learning, but alſo ſuffring Diuine things. But the latter way of iudging perteines to this Doctrine, in as much as it is gotten by study, although indeed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples therof come from Diuine Reuelation.</hi> Thus far are the Words of <hi>S. Thomas.</hi>

                        <p n="16">16. Yea euen Ariſtotle himſelfe though a Heathen could obſerue (lib. 2. magn. Moral. c. 7.) <hi>That to that good which is honeſt</hi> (and vertuous) <hi>there is firſt required a certaine Reaſonles impulſe: and therby the Reaſon is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to diſcerne and determine.</hi> But more pertinently and expresſly in the following Chapter <hi>he</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Good fortune is without any precedent Act of Reaſon. For by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is indeede fortunate that without the exerciſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is impelled to good or vertuous things, and atteines them.</hi> Now <hi>this is to be aſcribed to Nature: For ſuch (an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is naturally imprinted in our ſoules by which wee are impelled to ſuch things as will render us happy without any exerciſe of Reaſon: Inſomuch as if one ſhould aske any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo diſpoſed, Why doth it pleaſe thee to doe ſo? He would anſwer, Truly I know not: But ſo it pleaſeth mee to doe. The like happens to thoſe that are Diuinely inſpired and agitated: for ſuch are impelled to the doing of ſomethings without the exerciſe of Reaſon.</hi> Laſtly the ſame <hi>Philoſopher</hi> obſeruing that ſometimes there are ſuddenly iniected into ſome ſoules certaine <hi>good Thoughts and Deſires,</hi> from which many following good Actions doe proceed: And herupon enquiring from what Principle ſuch good
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48407:92"/> Thoughts may be iudged to proceede; He reſolues, that the ſoule herſelfe is not the cauſe of them, becauſe they preuent all exerciſe of Reaſon; Therfore the cauſe of them muſt be <hi>ſomewhat better then the ſoule;</hi> And that is only <hi>God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">17. The forementioned Illuſtration is ſuppoſed to be not in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> but purely in the <hi>vnderſtanding:</hi> As likevviſe the motion and <hi>Inclination</hi> to be in the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall will,</hi> and not in the <hi>ſenſitiue appetite:</hi> for othervviſe they vvould not deſerue ſo much to be relied on: becauſe the vvorkings of the imagination are ſo inconſtant and irregular; And the ſenſible motions of the <hi>Inferiour Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> (being in corporall Nature, producing a warmth about the heart, &amp; a ſtirring of ſpirits and Humours,) are ſo diſorderly, that they are very iuſtly ſuſpicious, and ſcarce to be truſted to. Therfore although in a feruent Exerciſe of much <hi>ſenſible Deuotion</hi> the ſenſuall Nature doe after her maner carry herſelfe well towards God, yet the <hi>Superiour Soule</hi> being not in a ſtate of due tranquillity and ſtillnes, is leſſe capable of Diuine Illuſtrations and Influxes: And therfore the ſoules Inclinations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and Deſignes at ſuch times are leſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Now if it should happen that after ſuch Tryalls by Prayer made for the knowing of the Diuine Will, the ſoule should yet perceiue no ſufficient light, nor any conſiderable Inclination, propenſion or preponderation tovvards one ſide, more then another; In this caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Thaulerus</hi> his iudgment, she may freely and confidently, as it vvere by lotts, make choice indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48407:92"/> of vvhether she thinkes fitt: And a choice ſo made, vvhen euer it happens, she may and ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue to be according to Gods vvill, ſince hauing done her part to knovv his vvill, after all, this is the Reſult of her Recollections, in vvhich she has to her vtmoſt povver carried herſelfe vvith Reſignation and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Notvvithſtanding in making a Choice in ſuch circumſtances she may doe vvell to vſe, or at leaſt to aduiſe vpon theſe <hi>Cautions.</hi> 1. Generally ſpeaking, vvhen tvvo things ſeeme in all reſpects to be equall, it vvere better, at leaſt ſafer, to chuſe that ſide on vvhich lies the greater Mortification to Nature. 2. She may doe vvell to make choice of the <hi>not-doing</hi> rather then the <hi>Doing:</hi> eſpecially if the Doing be likely to engage the ſoule in any diſtractions or ſollicitudes. For the Election of not-doing is more ſuitable to the Perfection of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue ſtate, and the ſpirit of our <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> that tends to God by <hi>Abstraction, Silence, Solitude</hi> &amp;c. 3. Let her chuſe that ſide vvhich she thinkes vvould be more agreable and better approued by vertuous and deuout friends. 4. Let her follovv the example of any one of vvhich she has a good opinion, in caſe the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns others; as if the queſtion be about giuing a ſuffrage in the Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Superiours &amp;c. 5. If the buſines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne herſelfe and her ovvne ſoules good only, she is not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies obliged to chuſe that vvhich in it ſelfe is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but therin she is to conſider her ovvne preſent ſtate &amp; Degree, and vvhether the choice vvill be likely to produce good or ill effects and inconueniences for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48407:93"/> future as vvell as the preſent. For example, it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it-ſelfe the moſt deſireable Perfection that a ſoule can aſpire to, and to vvhich she is alſo obliged to tend, to keepe herſelfe alvvaies in the Diuine Preſence, and in a conſtant ſtate of Recollectednes; or to renounce all manner of ſatisfactions to nature &amp;c. But if an imperfect ſoule should therfore attempt the exerciſe of Internall Prayer vvithout interruption, or to practiſe ſo vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall a Mortification, she vvould ouerthrovv corporall Nature vtterly, and in a short time by <hi>indiſcreete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing</hi> come to an inability to doe any thing at all. To her therfore in ſuch a ſtate that is to be eſteemed <hi>moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> vvhich in it ſelfe is leſſe perfect, to vvit, a feruent but moderate exerciſe both of Prayer and mortification, by vvhich she vvill be enabled by litle and litle to get ground vpon Nature, &amp; at laſt to doe that vvhich will be both in it ſelfe moſt Perfect, &amp; to her alſo.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. A ſoule hauing after the manner afore ſayd made a Reſolution &amp; Election, it is the <hi>Aduice</hi> of <hi>Michael Conſtantienſis,</hi> a Deuout <hi>Priour</hi> of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> that she should perſeuere in it, yea though aftervvards ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by ſome others should be ſuggeſted to her contrary to ſuch a Reſolution: although alſo that vvhich is ſo ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted should ſeeme to be more proffitable &amp; of greater Perfection. Iuſt after the ſame manner that a ſoule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once aduiſedly ſubmitted herſelfe to the Direction of a ſpirituall Guide, is not to hearken to, nor accept from any other any Reaſons contrary to his directions, nor any diſcouragements from obeying him. And ſurely, fayth he, a much greater obligation hath a ſoule to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48407:93"/> the interiour Counſell of God ſought by a Reſigned, perſeuering Prayer, to vvhich <hi>our Lord</hi> has giuen an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>whatſoeuer yee shall aske in my Name, beleiue that yee shall receiue it, &amp; it shall happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> And ſuch vvas the Practiſe of <hi>B. Angela de Fulginio</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. To this purpoſe it is very obſeruable in the life of the ſame <hi>B. Angela,</hi> That God commanded her to ſet downe in writing this paſſage (which is the only one for which she receiued ſuch a Command) to wit, <hi>That he would take away his light and grace from thoſe, who being brought immediatly to their Internall Maſter, would be ſo vngratefull as to forſake him, and be take themſelues to an Externall one: yea and that moreouer ſuch should haue a curſe from him: namely,</hi> if they did perſiſt in receding from the Diuine conduct, conſtantly preferring Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Directions before God's.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Yet this Aduice of being conſtant to a Reſolution ſo made, is to giue place. 1. In caſe <hi>a Superiour</hi> should command any thing contrary therto: For <hi>a Superiour</hi> muſt be obeyed euen againſt ſuch an Interiour Counſell: Becauſe a ſoule is not only counſelled, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey her Superiours. So that vvhenſoeuer <hi>a Superiour</hi> does deliberately diſapproue a Counſell ſo receiued, a Deuout ſoule is to beleiue that now it is Gods vvill that his former Counſell should ceaſe from being any further obliging. 2. In caſe that any other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumſtances shall occurre, vvhich may perhaps alter the ſtate of the difficulty. Notvvithſtanding ſuch a change is not to be made vpon this laſt ground, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48407:94"/> nevv recurring to God for light. Yea though the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for a change be neuer ſo cleare, yet it is beſt it should be made in vertue of Prayer, to the end it may be done vvith greater <hi>purity of Intention.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="23">23. Novv in all caſes of ſuch like Nature the Purpoſe and Reſolution is ſeldome to be made in the very time of our Recollections: Both becauſe (as hath bene ſayd) the thinking on ſuch matters is not the proper ſubiect of Praier, but is very diſtractiue: And likevviſe becauſe the <hi>Internall Illuſtrations</hi> and motions of <hi>Gods ſpirit</hi> are better perceiued after Prayer, vvhen the ſoule hauing bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, doth reflect on them.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. But it is othervviſe <hi>in matters of Reſignation,</hi> or vvhen vvee Pray for <hi>Patience</hi> and Tranquillity <hi>of mind in Croſses</hi> and Difficulties. For in ſuch caſes vve are to make our good purpoſes in our Praiers themſelues, and oft are to renevv them aftervvards: Becauſe ſuch Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes doe of themſelues preſently appeare to be cleare and obligatory: and beſides, they are proper matter for Praier.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. After that a ſoule hath made a Reſolution in the caſes, and after the manner aforeſayd, and likevviſe hath put the ſame in practiſe: Let the <hi>Iſsue</hi> be vvhat it vvill, vvhether proffitable or harmfull to nature; yet muſt she neuer eſteeme the Election to haue bene <hi>amiſſe:</hi> Nor muſt she hearken to the ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Nature, the vvhich finding in ſuch practiſes ſomething contrary to her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, vvill be apt by ſubtle inſinuations to moue the ſoule to repent, and to vndoe vvhat she hath done. Such an erroneous Iudgment procured by corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48407:94"/> is to be deſpiſed and depoſed. For vvell may vvee happen to erre in the manner of executing ſuch Counſell giuen vs by God, and therby, or by ſome other meanes, inconueniences or harmes may ſometimes befall vs: But the <hi>Election</hi> in it ſelfe, made in the manner aforeſayd, was good: and it would be an Act of Immortification to blame it, or to be ſorry for it. God for our good doth often turne our beſt deedes to our greateſt mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therby we reape a double benefitt.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. In ſuch <hi>Doubtfull caſes</hi> as haue here bene ſpoken of, a Soule muſt <hi>not expect an apparent euident Certitude,</hi> as Spirituall Writers ſay. For God to keepe the Soule in Humility, does not vſe to giue an abſolute aſſurance of the matter it ſelfe ſimply conſidered: but only a Certainty of being directed and dravvn more to one ſide of the Difficulty, then to the other: The vvhich ſide, in the Iudgment of the ſayd Authours, is to be choſen and follovved as the Diuine Will. So that any aduantage or preponderation, though neuer ſo litle, tovvards one ſide more then another, maketh certitude enough of Gods vvill, as for ſtanding to it. If there be no perceptible difference or leaning either vvay, the ſoule is either to take Aduice from ſome other; or to ſupply it vvith her naturall impartiall Reaſon; or euen as it vvere by Lots to chuſe vvhether she thinkes good. And vvhat she doth after this manner, she may equiualently be ſayd to doe as by the Direction and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the Diuine Spirit: Becauſe it is Gods Will and appointment, that vvhen himſelfe does not direct vs immediatly by his Spirit, vve should make vſe of other
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48407:95"/> inferiour, externall vvaies, the beſt vve can, for our Direction: in all thinges alvvaies intending his Glorie and encreaſe in his loue only.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. It vvould be a vaine, preſumptuous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tempting of God to goe and pray to the end to knovv his vvill in things commanded by <hi>known Lawes</hi> and by lavvfull <hi>Superiours:</hi> for <hi>they</hi> are appointed by him as the moſt aſſured <hi>Interpreters of his Will:</hi> And to expect any more, is to pretend to <hi>Extraordinary Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and <hi>Calls;</hi> Which are neither to be deſired, nor truſted to: becauſe there vvill be great danger of Illuſion by the Deuills counterfeyting a good Angell. And he that is ſo preſumptuous in his practiſe, deſerues that God permitt ſuch Illuſions.</p>

Novv though imperfect ſoules not being able as yet to driue avvay diſtracting images, &amp; to ſtill all vnruly Paſſions, are forced to content themſelues vvith their naturall light in many matters of leſſe importance, ſo that a great part of their ordinary Actions doe not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ſpirit: Yet perfecter ſoules walke almoſt continually in a ſupernaturall light, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing &amp; reſiſting the ſubtle inſinuations of ſelfe loue, &amp; not ſuffring themſelues haſtily to be pushed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards to Actions, before they haue conſulted their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Guide, &amp; much leſſe contrary to his directions.</p>

No
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48407:97"/> vvonder it is, if ſuch being ſtrangers to the <hi>Contemplatiue</hi> vvayes of the ſpirit, should be ignorant of theſe ſecret Paths by vvhich God leads ſoules to Perfection: in the vvhich none can tread, or at leaſt make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable progreſſe, till quitting a ſeruile dependance on externall teachers, they rely only vpon the Diuine Guidance. And for this propoſe deuout ſoules are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly &amp; oft to be exhorted to keepe themſelues in a diſpoſition of as much Abſtraction, both externall &amp; internall, as may be, to the end they may be enabled to heare &amp; diſcerne the Diuine Voyce: to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of vvhich if they vvill in practiſe faithfully correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond, God vvill be vvanting to them in nothing.</p>
                        <p n="8">8.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. LASTLY to preuent all miſunderſtanding of this moſt holy &amp; moſt neceſſary Doctrine touching our obligation to attend vnto (&amp; to practiſe accordingly) the Diuine Inſpirations directing vs to Acts of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as likevviſe to preuent all miſapplication therof by ſoules that ought &amp; are vvilling to follovv it: I vvill here take avvay the pretended grounds vpon vvhich ſome, vvho either out of ignorance, Paſſion or intereſt haue declared themſelues to be enemies therto, doe declame againſt it: ſuppoſing that they haue a great aduantage againſt it, vvhilſt they pretend that by the teaching &amp; practiſing of it great preiudice vvill come to the due
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48407:98"/> Authority of Superiours, from vvhich their ſubiects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving theſe Inſtructions vvill endeauour to exempt themſelues, vpon a pretext of Diuine Inſpirations to the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For the clearing therfore &amp; diſſoluing of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed difficulty &amp; inconuenience, wee are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that though in this diſcourſe vvee haue promiſcuouſly vſed the termes of <hi>inſpirations, lights, impulſes, diuine calls</hi> &amp;c. yet the former are only ſuch operations of God as are Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: vvheras the terme of <hi>Diuine Calls</hi> imports both an externall ordination of God, &amp; alſo his internall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our ſoules ſuitable to the externall call. And both theſe are properly termed <hi>Calls,</hi> becauſe by both of them God doth ſignify his vvill to ſoules: For <hi>by the externall ordination</hi> &amp; commiſſion giuen by God to all in lavvfull authority vnder him, God by them doth reueyle his vvill vnto vs, vvhich vvee obey vvhilſt vvee ſubmit vnto &amp; execute the commands &amp; vvills of his <hi>Subſtitutes.</hi> And <hi>by his internall operation</hi> he directs vs to performe ſuch obedience, in a ſpirituall manner, for the good &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of our ſoules in his DIVINE LOVE.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 All <hi>Lawes</hi> therfore, all <hi>Constitutions, Precepts &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Superiours,</hi> &amp; all externall or internall Dutyes of obligation by vertue of our ſtate of life as <hi>Christians,</hi> or moreouer as <hi>Religious</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiasticall Perſons</hi> &amp;c. are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, &amp; ſo to be eſteemed by vs, <hi>true Diuine Calls,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be attended to, knovvn &amp; performed by vs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And as for <hi>Internall Inſpirations</hi> vvhich haue regard vnto thoſe <hi>externall Calls,</hi> the end for vvhich they are giuen vs is, not only ſimply to direct &amp; incline vs to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48407:99"/> performe all our Chriſtian, Regular or other dutyes vvith readines &amp; chearfullnes, but to doe them vvith perfection &amp; purity of intention, in &amp; for God only, as if he had immediatly &amp; viſibly impoſed them vpon vs. And for as much as concernes the <hi>Not-doing</hi> (to the vvhich. I ſayd that in a Contemplatiue life the Diuine Inſpirations doe inuite vs) that is meant only in matters either indifferent, or at leaſt to the vvhich vvee haue no obligation by vertue of any externall lavv. Yea on the contrary, vve may ſay, that <hi>our Holy Rule</hi> (the end vvherof is to diſpoſe &amp; leade vs to a perfect vnion vvith God by Contemplation) doth in generall oblige vs to ſuch abſtraction &amp; <hi>Not-doing,</hi> vvherſoeuer it doth not require the doing of any thing of vs.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Therfore vvhatſoeuer internall ſuggeſtions, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or impulſes vvee may find that shall be contrary or preiudiciall to ſuch externall Calls to Obedience &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, vvee are to be ſo far from hearkning to them, or eſteeming them for Diuine, that vvee ought to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe &amp; reiect them, iudging them to be no better then diabolicall illuſions. Yea this is to hold, although the ſayd externall lavves, Commands or obſeruances be ſuch, as vvee in our priuate iudgments cannot thinke to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper or conuenient for vs in particular.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Novv the reaſon vvhy no internall ſuggeſtion ought to take place of externall obligations is euident &amp; conuincing: Becauſe ſuch externall Calls to obedience being of themſelues both manifeſt, &amp; certainly vnque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable tokens &amp; expreſſions of the Diuine vvill, they ought not to giue place to any ſuppoſed internall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48407:99"/> of the ſame vvill vvhatſoeuer, vvhich are not, nor can be ſo manifeſt: but rather to preſcribe Rules vnto them, &amp; ouerrule them. Wee knovv the former to be Gods vvill, &amp; to proceed from him: &amp; therfore vve can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally beleiue that thoſe things that are oppoſite therto, can be acceptable to him. Beſides Gods vvill reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a ſubiect by the mouth of his Superiour, or by eſtablished lavves, has a kinde of <hi>publick authority,</hi> being deriued by a publick perſon &amp; meane: &amp; therfore muſt needs take place &amp; be preferred before an Inſpiration or ſignification of the Diuine vvill to a priuate perſon alone.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Yea moreouer, ſo indiſpenſably carefull, &amp; euen ſcrupulous ought vvee to be that exteriour order &amp; due ſubordination appoynted by God, should not vpon any pretence be preiudiced: that vve are to regard the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Superiours euen in doing or omitting thoſe things vvhich are not vvithin the compaſſe of any ſpeciall lavves or commands, but are left to our ovvne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty &amp; Iudgment. So that vvee ought not to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution any thing to vvhich vvee are by an Internall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration inuited or directed, vvithout the approbation &amp; leaue (eyther expreſſe, or interpretatiue) of our Superiour: &amp; if the matter be of conſiderable moment, his expreſſe permiſſion is requiſite.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Yea I vvill adde further, that if a Religious ſubiect shall haue an Inſpiration, vvhich he confidently beleiues to be Diuine, by vvhich he is inuited to the doing of any thing: yet if his Superiour shall declare ſuch an Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not to be Diuine, &amp; forbid the executing of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48407:100"/> vvhat it directs, the ſubiect ought not only to obey his Superiour by forbearing to doe according to ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but he is alſo obliged to ſubmit his iudgment, &amp; to beleiue his Superiour. And this he may ſincerely &amp; ſecurely doe. Becauſe though it vvere ſo that in truth the Inſpiration came from God, &amp; did direct to the doing of a thing more perfect, or to a more perfect omiſſion: yet all this is to be vnderſtood only <hi>conditionally,</hi> that is, vpon ſuppoſition that a lavvfull Superiour did not iudge &amp; command othervviſe. For in ſuch a caſe, it vvould be an Act of greater Perfection in the ſubiect to obey him forbidding the doing or forbearing of any thing, though in it ſelfe (&amp; ſuch prohibition not conſidered) more Perfect. Yea &amp; a Diuine light &amp; nevv inſpiration vvill informe &amp; direct the ſubiect to obey &amp; beleiue the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour declaring againſt the former Inſpiration. For though nothing that a Superiour in ſuch circumſtances can ſay vvill make the former Inſpiration not to haue come from God, yet his declaring againſt it vvill shevv it not to be of force novv: ſince that all ſuch Inſpirations doe, &amp; ought to ſuppoſe the conſent, or at leaſt the <hi>non-oppoſition</hi> of the Superiour before they be put in practiſe: and therfore they are to giue place to an inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of obeying, vvhich is <hi>abſolute.</hi> True it is, that in ſuch a caſe it may happen that the Superiour may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a great fault &amp; muſt expect to be accountable to God for it: but hovvſoeuer, the ſubiect in obeying ſuch an vndue command, shall not only be innocent, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo merit therby: Becauſe in both caſes he doth vvell: firſt in being prepared to obey the <hi>former Inſpiration,</hi>
                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48407:100"/> vvhich vvas <hi>conditionall;</hi> &amp; aftervvards in contradicting that, to obey <hi>a ſecond Inſpiration</hi> of ſubmitting to his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, vvhich vvas <hi>abſolute.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. As it concernes therfore particular ſoules to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend principally vpon their <hi>Internall Directour:</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe are <hi>Superiours</hi> &amp; <hi>Spirituall Guides</hi> no leſſe obliged to penetrate into the diſpoſitions of their ſubiects &amp; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; to diſcouer by vvhat ſpeciall vvayes the Spirit of God conducts them, &amp; ſuitably therto to conforme themſelues &amp; to comply vvith the intention of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Spirit. And this Duty our <hi>Holy Patriarke</hi> in the 64. Chap. of his <hi>Rule,</hi> requires from all Abbots or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours: <hi>forbidding</hi> them to vſe rigour in the correction of their ſubiects, or <hi>ſo rudely to ſcoure the veſsells, as therby to endanger the breaking of them. He would not haue them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be reſtleſsly ſuſpicious &amp; iealous ouer their ſubiects:</hi> But in their impoſitions to vſe <hi>great Diſcretion (which</hi> he calls <hi>the Mother of vertues</hi>) conſidering each ones ability, <hi>&amp; ſaying with Iacob, If I force my flocks to trauaile beyond their strength they will all of them die at once</hi> &amp;c. If the Superiour therfore in an humour of commanding, on his ovvne head should impoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands on his ſubiects, vvithout any regard to the diuine vvill &amp; guidance: ſuch commands vvill probably proue vnproſperous as to the ſubiect, &amp; certainly very dangerous to the Superiour. Yet ſo it may be, that the Subiect may reape ſpirituall proffit by them: for then it may pleaſe God to giue him an Interiour enablement to turne ſuch vndue commands to his ovvne good &amp; aduancement, by encreaſing in him the Habit of Reſignation &amp; Humility. It vvill indeed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48407:101"/> be very hard for <hi>imperfect Soules</hi> to reape benefit by ſuch impertinent Superiours: But as for <hi>Perfect</hi> ones, they haue both light &amp; Spirituall ſtrength to conuert all the moſt vnreaſonable Commands of Superiours to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit &amp; aduancement of their ovvne Soules.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. In caſe a Superiour should forbid his Subiect to pray at this or that time: or should command him to ſpend no longer then ſuch a ſmall ſpace of time in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Praier, as vvould not ſuffiſe for his aduancement in the Internall vvaies of the Spirit: The Rule of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction requires the Subiect to obey his Superiour: Yet he may vvith all Humility remonſtrate to him his Spirituall neceſſities, acquainting him vvith the great benefit that his ſoule finds in a Conſtant performance of his Recollections, &amp; in attending to Diuine Inſpirations, and vvhat preiudice it might be to him to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or abridged of them. But if the Superiour doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, he muſt be obeyed, and God vvill ſome other vvay ſupply the loſſe the Subiect finds in ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Obediences. Novv though a Superiour can no more forbid in generall the vſe of Internall Prayer &amp; of obſeruing Diuine Inſpirations, then he can forbid the Louing or Obeying of God: Yet vvhether Prayer shall be exerciſed at ſuch certaine appointed times, or for ſuch a determinate ſpace of time, that is vvithin the limits of a Superiours Authority: And hovv he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes that Authority, it vvill concerne him to conſider. For if he guides ſoules according to his ovvne vvill, and not Gods (and ſurely Gods Internall Inſpirations are his vvill) beſides the guilt that he shall contract by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48407:101"/> of his authority, he muſt expect that all the harme or preiudice that his ſubiects ſoules through his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariage shall incurre, vvill be heaped &amp; multiplied vpon his ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But concerning the Duties &amp; obligations of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi> tovvards ſoules vvhoſe Profeſſion is to treade theſe Internall vvayes of Contemplation, more shall be ſayd herafter in its proper place: vvhere it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, That theſe Inſtructions are ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicing their Authority, that true Cordiall obedience vvill neuer, nor can be perfectly performed to them but by ſuch ſoules as are moſt zealous &amp; conſtant in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Duties of Prayer and attending to the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. To conclude this vvhole Diſcourſe concerning Diuine Inſpirations: As theſe Aduiſes are not curiouſly to be applied to the practiſe of fearfull ſcrupulous ſoules, vvhoſe vnquiet thoughts make them in a manner incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of either Light or Impulſes of Gods ſpirit in matters about vvhich their ſcrupuloſity is exerciſed: So in thoſe caſes they are to follovv Inſtructions peculiarly proper to them. But for as much as concernes all other vvell-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Soules that leade Contemplatiue liues, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ought to be ſeriouſly recommended to them, and they are to be taught hovv to practiſe it. For by this &amp; no other vvay can they aſſuredly vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or performe the Diuine Will, in the vvhich alone conſiſts Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Perfection. By theſe Inſpirations alone the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour is regulated, vvithout vvhich all Exteriour good cariage is litle auayleable to Perfection. No Externall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48407:102"/> Directour can order the Interiour Operations of the Soule, either in Prayer or Mortification: None but God alone vvho knovves &amp; ſearches the Hearts of Men. And his principall vvay of directing is by his Inſpirations: the vvhich by the acknovvledgement of all good Chriſtians are neceſſary to euery Action, to make it good or <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> Theſe Inſpirations therfore vvee muſt follovv: Therfore they may be knovvn, for vvee can not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to follovv an inuiſible &amp; vndiſcernable light, vvee knovv not vvhat. And if they may be knovvn, ſurely the Rules here preſcribed for that purpoſe, (to vvit, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of life, &amp; pure, reſigned Prayer) are the moſt ſecure and moſt efficacious Meanes to come to that knovvledge, and to procure Grace to vvorke according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. And it may very reaſonably be beleiued, that the principall ground &amp; reaſon vvhy true Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is in theſe dayes ſo rare, and vvhy matters goe ſo amiſſe among ſoules that pretend to aſpire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, is becauſe this moſt neceſſary duty of obſeruing and follovving Diuine Inſpirations is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnknovvn, or vvilfully miſunderſtood, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected (if not derided) by ſome vvho in popular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion are held and deſire to paſſe for cheife Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in ſpirituality. And no vvonder is it that ſuch should be diſaffected to this doctrine, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect practiſe vvherof themſelues are incapable, by reaſon of their diſtractiue employments and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree of Prayer; and conſequently neither can they, nor perhaps if they could, vvould they

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48407:103"/> vvho by a Diuine vocation doe vndertake that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime courſe of life: and in conſequence therto hauing demonſtrated that <hi>the only ſufficient Maiſter and Guide</hi> in ſuch a Life <hi>is God,</hi> and his Diuine Inſpirations, by whom alone both Diſciples and alſo Maiſters &amp; Guides muſt be directed: It remaines in the third place that I should shew what and vvhere <hi>the Schoole</hi> is, wherin ordinarily this Diuine Maiſter inſtructs his Diſciples in this ſo Heauenly Diuine Doctrine &amp; Science.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now by the vnanimous acknowledgment of all Myſtick writers <hi>the only proper Schoole of Contemplation is Solitude:</hi> that is, a condition of life both <hi>externally</hi> freed from the diſtractiue Encombrances, tempting flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and diſquietting Sollicitudes of the vvorld: and likevviſe vvherin the minde <hi>Internally</hi> is in a good Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, at leaſt in ſerious deſire, freed alſo from inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affection to all vvorldly and Carnall Obiects: that ſo the ſoule may be at leiſure to attend vnto God, vvho deſerues all our thoughts and Affections, and to practiſe ſuch Duties of Mortification and Praier, as diſpoſe her for an Immediate perfect Vnion vvith Him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Novv though this ſo neceſſary Solitude be found both more perfectly and more permanently in a vvell-ordred <hi>Religious State,</hi> vvhich affords likevviſe many other aduantages (ſcarſe to be found elſevvhere) for a better practiſing the Exerciſes diſpoſing to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: Yet is it not ſo confined to that State, but that in the vvorld alſo, and in <hi>a Secular Courſe of Life</hi> God hath oft raiſed and Guided many Soules in theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vvaies, affording them euen there as much Solitude
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48407:104"/> and as much Internall Freedome of ſpirit, as he ſavv vvas neceſſary to bring them to a high Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And indeed it is an Illuſtrious Proofe of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, moſt communicatiue, ouerflovving Riches of the Diuine Goodnes to all his Seruants vvhatſoeuer that in truth of Heart ſeeke him, that <hi>this State of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> (being the Supremeſt and moſt Diuine that an Intellectuall Soule is capable of either in this Life, or in Heauen alſo) should neither be encloſed only in Cauernes, Rocks or deſarts, nor fixed to Solitary Religious Communities, Nor appropriated to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of vvitt, profoundnes of Iudgment, Gifts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Study &amp;c. But that the pooreſt ſimpleſt Soule liuing in the vvorld, and follovving the common life of good Chriſtians there, if she vvill faithfully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the Internall Light and Tracts afforded her by Gods Spirit, may as ſecurely, yea and ſometimes more ſpeedily arriue to the <hi>Top of the Mountaine of Viſion,</hi> then the learnedſt Doctours, the moſt profoundly vviſe Men, yea the moſt abſtracted confined Hermites.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Yea both Hiſtory &amp; fresher Experience doe aſſure vs, that in theſe latter times God hath as freely (and perhaps more commonly) communicated the Diuine Lights and Graces proper to a <hi>Contemplatiue life</hi> to ſimple vvomen, endued vvith leſſer &amp; more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Gifts of Iudgment, but yet enriched vvith ſtronger Wills and more feruent Affections to him, then the ableſt Men. And the reaſon herof vvee may iudge to be, partly, <hi>becauſe</hi> God therby should, as is moſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48407:104"/> due, reape all the Glory of his moſt free Graces, the vvhich if they did vſually attend our Naturall Endovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvould be challenged as due to our ovvne abilities and endeauours: And <hi>partly</hi> alſo, becauſe as ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall <hi>Holines,</hi> ſo the perfection of it vvhich is Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, conſiſts far more principally in the <hi>Operations of the will</hi> then of the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> (as shall be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in due place:) And ſince vvomen doe far more abound, and are far more conſtant &amp; fixed in Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and other Operations of the vvill then Men, (though inferiour in thoſe of the vnderſtanding) No meruayle if God doth oft find them fitter ſubiects for his Graces then Men.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And for this reaſon it is (beſides that vvomen are leſſe encombred vvith Sollicitous buſineſſes abroad, (their Secular Employments being chiefly Domeſticall vvithin their ovvne vvalls) that they doe far more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repaire to the Churches, more aſſiduouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their Deuotions both there &amp; at home, &amp; reape the Bleſſings of the Sacraments more plentifully: (V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vvhich grounds, the Church calls them the <hi>deuout ſexe:</hi>) Inſomuch as a very Spirituall and experienced Authour did not doubt to pronounce, that (according to his beſt iudgment vvhich vvas grounded on more then only outvvard appearances) <hi>for One Man, nere ten Women went to Heauen.</hi> Notvvithſtanding true it is, that the Contemplations of Men are more noble, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime &amp; more exalted in Spirit, that is, leſſe partaking of ſenſible effects, as Rapts, Extaſies or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue repreſentations, as likevviſe melting ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48407:105"/> of affections then thoſe of vvomen.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Novv though the true &amp; immediate Motiue of the vvriting of theſe Spirituall Inſtructions vvas the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of certaine Deuout Religious Soules in the vvay of Contemplation, to the aſpiring vvherto their Profeſſion did oblige them: And for this Reaſon moſt of the ſaid Inſtructions are intended to be moſt proper for ſuch. Yet being a Debtour to all vvellminded Soules vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that deſire to treade in the ſayd Internall vvayes, I vvill here breifly shevv hovv they alſo may make vſe of my vvritings for the ſame End, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence ſelecting ſuch ſpeciall Directions as may alſo as vvell belong to them, and paſſing ouer thoſe that are more peculiarly proper to Soules in a Religious State.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In the vvorld therfore there are tvvo ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that doe, or may, aſpire vnto Contemplation, or Perfection in Prayer, to vvit, 1. <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> 2. <hi>Lay-Perſons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. Firſt as for <hi>Eccleſiasticks</hi> (I meane eſpecially Preiſts, to vvhich all other inferiour Orders doe tend) they not only may, but ought ſeriouſly to aſpire therunto: yea perhaps more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                           <hi>ſimple Religious:</hi> For their moſt ſublime, and by all Ancient Saints deemed ſo formidable an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (by vvhich they are empovverd and obliged vvith immaculate Sacrifices and feruent Prayers to be dayly Interceſſours vvith God for the vvhole Church) preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them to haue already atteined to a good Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectednes in Prayer. And if moreouer they haue a charge of Soules, they will neede a far greater ſtability ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: that their various Employments may be performed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48407:105"/> purely for and in God, and not breake their vnion with him. Moreouer by their Profeſſion their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come nere to the vovves of Religious: Perſons for 1. They ovve an Obedience to Superiours, though not in euery Ordinary Action. 2. They Profeſſe the ſame Chaſtity. 3. They ought to haue litle more propriety in their Goods: For vvhatſoeuer is beyond their Moderate neceſſity &amp; Obligation of Hoſpitable Charity, they can litle more diſpoſe of vvithout vvrong to the Poore &amp;c. then Religious. 4. Though their Employments require from them more Conuerſation vvith others, then the ſtate of Religious does, yet they are as vvell obliged to diſengage their Affections from all loue or Sollicitude about Riches &amp;c. as the others are: And in like manner to free themſelues from all Diſtractiue Employments not belonging neceſſarily to their Calling.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And vpon theſe grounds it vvas, that in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and beſt times of the Church, ſcarce any durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to vndertake ſo high and Perfect a Calling, as the Charge of Soules is, till after many yeares firſt ſpent in a kind of Religious Abſtraction of life, Solitude, Silence, great Mortifications and aſſiduous Praier &amp;c. Witnes <hi>S. Baſile, S. Gregory Nazianzene, S. Gregory Nyſſen, S. Chryſostome, S. Auguſtin. S.

And vvhen they vvere compelled by God or Men therto, they vvere far from thinking themſelues diſobliged from a Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48407:106"/> of their Contemplatiue Exerciſes of Abſtraction, Mortification &amp; Praier &amp;c. But on the contrary they ſtole time euen from their neceſſary Refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Sleepe to employ in their Recollections, as knovving that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they could doe vvould be acceptable to God, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it proceeded in vertue of Grace obteined by Praier.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But the beſt proofe &amp; example of the Obligations of an Eccleſiaſticall Perſon is our <hi>Bleſsed Sauiour</hi> Himſelfe: vvho though by vertue of the Hypoſtaticall Vnion he vvas replenished vvith all manner of Graces vvithout meaſure, and therfore had no neede at all, as for himſelfe, to pray for more, yet to shevv an example moſt neceſſary to vs, He tooke not on him the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conuerting others, till he had ſpent the former thirty yeares of his life in Solitude, Silence and all the moſt holy Internall Exerciſes at home, vvhere he liued vnobſerued &amp; vnknovvn vnto the vvorld. And during all the time of his moſt laborious Execution of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Office,</hi> beſides: much Praier exerciſed openly before others, the Goſpell expreſſely ſaies, that his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome vvas at Night to retire himſelfe vvith his Diſciples to Praier: Yea &amp; vvhenſoeuer any great vvorke vvas to be done, as before the Miſſion of the Diſciples and Apoſtles, that he ſpent vvhole Nights alone in Praier. Adde hereunto that he vtterly refuſed to meddle in Secular affaires or Controuerſies, he frequented the Deſarts &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. So that <hi>an Eccleſiasticall Perſon</hi> both for his ovvne ſake, and out of a tender loue to his flock, ought to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48407:106"/> thinke himſelfe more obliged then before, to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all Internall <hi>Contemplatiue</hi> Exerciſes: and aboue all others, of Pure Spirituall Praier, which alone will ſanctify &amp; make ſucceſſefull both to himſelfe &amp; others all other Actions belonging to his Profeſſion. And hence it is, that <hi>S. Florentius</hi> an Ancient Holy <hi>Bishop,</hi> firſt <hi>of Vtrecht</hi> and aftervvards <hi>of Munſter,</hi> vvhen he vvas reprehended by ſome for ſpending ſo much time in Praier, as if thereby he vvas hindred from a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcharge of his Epiſcopall function, returned them an anſvvere very becoming a Perfect, Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Bishop,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Quid?

                        <p n="13">13. Such is the Duty, and ſuch the Obligations of Eccleſiaſticall Perſons. But if there be any Conſcious to themſelues of neglect in this matter, and deſirous to repaire paſt omiſſions by future Diligence, they may, if they thinke good, make vſe of theſe ſimple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the vvhich generally in the ſubſtance are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per enough for them, if they will only ſeparate certaine circumſtances &amp; reſpects in them, vvhich are peculiar to Religious.</p>

                           <p>§. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Such a Soule needs not to apprehend want, if conſecrating her ſelfe to God, she shall relinquish world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sollicitudes.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. IN the next place as concerning <hi>a Secular Perſon</hi> not in Holy Orders, that liues a Common life in the world, of what ſexe or Condition ſoeuer (for with God there is no difference or acceptation of Perſons) to whom the Diuine Spirit shall haue giuen an Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Call to ſeeke God in theſe Internall vvaies of Contemplation; yet ſo as that they doe not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues obliged to forſake a Secular Profeſſion and to embrace a Religious life: (Of vvhich State the Perſon perhaps being Married, or othervviſe hindred, is not Capable, or hovveuer finds no inclination therto:) Such a Soule may make benefit alſo of theſe Inſtructions, though purpoſely vvritten for <hi>Religious:</hi> in as much as many of them doe generally belong to all Perſons tending to Perfection: And thoſe that ſeeme more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Religious, yet vvith ſome qualifications and applications (ſuch as ordinary Diſcretion vvill teach) thoſe Inſtructions alſo may afford vnto them ſome good
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48407:107"/> helpe and vſefull benefit. And for that purpoſe they may doe vvell to take into their conſideration, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto their ovvne aduantage in Practiſe theſe follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aduices.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A deuout Soule therfore being inſpired by God to ſuch a courſe, and liuing in the vvorld, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue herſelfe obliged as truly and as properly (though not altogether equally) as any of a Religious Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the practiſe of theſe Subſtantiall &amp; Eſſentiall Duties and Inſtructions follovving, viz. 1. <hi>A Strong</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, notvvithſtanding any Contradictions and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to purſue by the Diuine aſſiſtance the vvaies tending to Contemplation. 2. <hi>An Equall care</hi> to Obſerue, and faithfully to execute all <hi>Diuine Inſpirations,</hi> and to diſpoſe herſelfe likevviſe (as is here taught) for the better receiuing &amp; diſcerning of them. 3. <hi>The practiſe</hi> both of Externall &amp; Internall <hi>Mortifications.</hi> (I meane thoſe vvhich through the Diuine Prouidence are ſent her, or doe belong to her preſent State and Condition of Life. And as for <hi>voluntary Mortifications,</hi> she is likevviſe to behaue herſelfe according to the follovving Directions.) 4. <hi>The Exerciſe of Internall Praier,</hi> according to the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Degrees of it. In theſe generall Duties there is litle or no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvvene the obligation of Religious from that of Secular Perſons.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But vvheras in the next place there are in this Booke many Inſtructions that ſeeme peculiar to Soules of a Religious Profeſſion: Such I meane, as are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon, and referr'd vnto a life abſtracted from the vvorld, confined vnto Solitude, and there limited
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48407:108"/> with a ſtrict encloſure of ſpeciall <hi>Lawes, Conſtitutions, Obſeruances</hi> &amp;c. Euen in theſe alſo <hi>a Secular Deuout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> tending to Contemplation may thinke himſelfe in ſome proportion &amp; degree concerned &amp; intereſted: And from them he may reape much benefit, applying to his ovvne vſe ſo much of the Spirit of Religion, as Diſcretion vvill shevv to be fruitfull to him. Novv for a better application of this Aduice, I vvill exemplify in certaine peculiar Duties of a Religious life, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shevv in vvhat ſort a Secular perſon may doe vvell, yea &amp; in ſome proportion is obliged to imitate them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Firſt</hi> therfore, ſuch a ſoule though she be not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged really &amp; perſonally to vvithdravv herſelfe from vvorldly conuerſation, &amp; to retire herſelfe into a ſolitude as ſtrict as that of Religion; Yet ſo much ſolitude &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence she muſt needs allovv herſelfe dayly, as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a due practiſe of Internall Prayer. Neither muſt she engage herſelfe in any buſineſſes of ſollicitude, &amp; diſtraction, that doe not neceſſarily belong to her Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And euen thoſe alſo muſt she performe vvith as much internall quietnes &amp; Recollectednes as may be, carefully auoyding all anxiety of mind, care of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Riches &amp;c. And as for <hi>vaine conuerſations, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all viſits, Feaſtings &amp;c.</hi> she muſt not thinke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnto herſelfe ſuch a free ſcope, as others doe, &amp; as formerly herſelfe did. But she muſt ſet a greater value vpon her precious time; as much vvherof as she can bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv from the neceſſary employments of her Calling, ought to be ſpent vpon the aduancing of her ſpirit in the vvay of Contemplation. And she indeed vvill find the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48407:108"/> great inconueniences that doe attend vaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſations, as diſſipation of thoughts, engagements in nevv vnnecſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary affaires, ſenſuall friendships &amp;c. all vvhich she ought carefully to preuent &amp; auoyd.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuch a ſoule, is by vertue of her nevv Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Vocation, obliged ſtudiouſly to imitate eſpecially the Internall ſolitude belonging to a Religious Perſon: abſtracting her ſpirit, as much as may be, both from all affection to outvvard things, as Riches, Pleaſures &amp;c: and like vviſe from the Images of Creatures &amp; worldly obiects. For vvhich purpoſe she is to performe all the Duties of her externall vocation in order to God, &amp; in ſubordination to her principall deſigne, vvhich is the Perfectionating of her ſpirit in the Diuine Loue. She is therfore not to account herſelfe as abſolute Miſtriſſe of the Riches that God hath giuen her, but only as his ſtevvard to manage them ſo as may be moſt to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that in the midſt of them, she ought to exerciſe true <hi>Pouerty of ſpirit;</hi> renouncing all propriety ioyned vvith affection to them, ſo as not to be diſquieted if God should take them from her: &amp; making no more vſe of them for her ovvne ſenſuall contentment, or for shevv in the vvorld, then shall in true Diſcretion be neceſſary. This <hi>Internall ſolitude, Introuerſion &amp; nakedneſse of ſpirit</hi> she muſt encreaſe, as much as may be, both in her affection to it, &amp; practiſe of it, ſo that it may become habituall to her. Becauſe vvithout it she vvill neuer be in a fit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to attend vnto the Diuine Inſpirations, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Internall duties of Prayer &amp;c. belonging to a ſtate tending to Contemplation.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48407:109"/>6. <hi>Thirdly</hi> in conformity to Religious Obedience, she is to behaue herſelfe to all thoſe in the vvorld vvhom God hath ſet ouer her, vvith a moſt profound ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpirit, obeying them, or rather God in them, vvith all purity of intention. And moreouer she is, at the firſt eſpecially, to put herſelfe vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſpirituall Directour, if ſuch an one be to be had: Who is to teach her hovv she may diſcerne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Prayer &amp; Mortification proper for her. And in the choice of ſuch an one, she is to vſe the vtmoſt of her Prudence, recommending vvithall an affaire of ſuch importance in her Prayers to God, that he vvould prouide her one of ſufficient abilities &amp; vertue, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially one that is experienced in thoſe Internall vvayes much exalted aboue the ordinary exerciſes of Prayer commonly taught &amp; practiſed. And vvhen God has found out ſuch an one for her, she is vvith all ſincerity &amp; humility to obey him; Yet vvithout preiudice to the duty vvhich shee principally ovves to her Diuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Maſter, as hath bene taught in the foregoeing Section; The Doctrine and Practice vvherof doth as vvell belong to her, as to any Religious Perſon.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> although ſuch a ſoule be not by any vovv or othervviſe obliged to any Rule, or reſtreined by any Conſtitutions or Regular obſeruances: Notvvthſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding she is to reduce the vvhole courſe of her Actions &amp; behauiour to a certaine order, Regularity and <hi>vniformity:</hi> Obſeruing in her Retirements, Reading, Praying, as alſo her Refections, ſleepe &amp;c. an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Practiſe both for times &amp; manner, according as Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48407:109"/> &amp; her Spirituall Guide shall ordaine. <hi>This order &amp; Vniformity</hi> obſerued diſcreetly (yet vvithout any nice ſcrupuloſity) is very requiſite in an Internall courſe. For othervviſe a ſoule being left at large, vvill be vnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; vncertaine in her moſt neceſſary Duties.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It vvill not be neceſſary to exemplify in any more particulars: for the ſame reflections &amp; the like applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may a ſoule make from any other Inſtructions &amp; duties peculiarly deſigned for Religious Perſons. Beſides, if she purſue diligently &amp; conſtantly her Internall Prayer, God vvill not be vvanting to afford her ſufficient Internall light, &amp; likevviſe ſtrong impulſes &amp; Spirituall force to follovv ſuch light: To the vvhich if she faithfully correſpond, she vvill find that ſince God has not giuen her a Vocation to Religion, yet he has not depriued her of the means of enioying in the vvorld in a ſufficient manner the principall aduantages of a Religious State (except the ſolemne Vovves themſelues:) Yea in this caſe she may, not altogether vnprobably, thinke that it vvas for her ovvne particular good that God did not giue her an opportunity to enter into Religion.</p>

                        <p n="6">6.

                        <p n="1">1. IT concernes a ſoule very much to examine vvell the <hi>motiues</hi> inducing her to enter into a Religious State: for if they be not according to God, it is to be feared she vvill not find all the Proffit &amp; ſatisfaction,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48407:113"/> that she promiſes to herſelfe. For. 1. <hi>If ſuch</hi> a Profeſſion be vndertaken merely out of vvorldly reſpects, as to gaine a ſtate of ſubſiſtence more ſecure (&amp; perhaps more plentifull.) 2. Or to auoyd ſuits, debates or vvordly da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers &amp;c. (vnleſſe ſuch incommodities haue giuen only occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a Soule to reflect on the vanities and Miſeries of the vvorld, and from thence to conſider and loue Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall &amp; Celeſtiall good things, vvhich are permanent and vvithout bitternes.) 3. <hi>Or if</hi> ſuch a State be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken out of a generall good deſire of Sauing ones ſoule, according to the fashion of ordinary good Chriſtians, &amp; no more: but vvithout a Speciall, determinate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to labour after Perfection in the Diuine Loue; either becauſe ſuch ſoules knovv nothing of it; or if they doe, haue not the courage, and vvill to attempt it: but reſolue to content themſelues vvith being freed from vvorldly Tentations &amp; dangers, and vvith a Moderate care to practiſe the Externall Obſeruances of Religion, yet vvithout ſufficient Purity of Intention or a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the proper End of a Religious Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue life &amp;c. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tell vvhether Perſons liuing &amp; dying in Religion vvithout further deſignes of purifying their Soules, shall find ſo great cauſe to reioyce for the choice they haue made: Since their beginning &amp; continuing is indeede no better then a Stable courſe of <hi>moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tepidity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Hovveuer as for ſoules that for externall reſpects haue embraced a Religious life: let them not therfore in a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate humour conclude, that no good can come to them by it ſo vnvvorthily vndertaken: But rather hope that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48407:114"/> by a Speciall Prouidence of God they vvere euen againſt their ovvne intentions &amp; vvills brought into a courſe of life, to vvhich if hovveuer aftervvard they vvill duly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond, it vvill proue an infinite bleſſing vnto them. For ſuch oftimes haue proued great <hi>Saints,</hi> after that God gaue them light to ſee their peruerſe Intentions, and Grace to rectify them: By vvhich meanes they <hi>beginning in the flesh, haue ended in the Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. And as for the <hi>third ſort (of Tepide perſons,</hi> it much concerns them, at leaſt after their ſolemne Profeſſion to ſearch vvell into their Soules, and there rectify vvhat they find amiſſe: taking great heede hovv they relye vpon Externall Obſeruances, Obediences or Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the vvhich though they be neceſſarily to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet cannot vvithout great danger and harme be reſted in, but muſt needs be directed to a further and Nobler End, to vvit, the Aduancement of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Neither let them conclude the Security of their Condition and good diſpoſition of ſoule from a certaine Compoſednes and quietnes of Nature, the vvhich vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be cauſed by Internall Mortification and Praier, is but mere ſelfe loue. And much leſſe let them rely vpon the eſteeme and good opinion that others may haue of them: Nor likevviſe on their ovvne abilities to diſcourſe of Spirituall matters, and giue Directions to others; ſince no Naturall light, nor acquired learning or ſtudy can be ſufficient to enable any one to treade in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vvaies, vvithout the ſerious practiſe of Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Prayer. A ſufficient proofe vvherof vvee ſee in <hi>Thaulerus,</hi> Who vvas able to make an Excellent Sermon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48407:114"/> of Perfection, but not to direct himſelfe in the vvay to it, till God ſent him a poore, ignorant <hi>Lay-man</hi> for his Inſtructour.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. What is it therfore that a ſoule truly called by God to enter into Religion lookes for? Surely not Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall labours: Not the vſe of the Sacraments: Not hearing of Sermons &amp;c. For all theſe she might haue enioyed perhaps more plentifully in the vvorld. It is therfore <hi>Only the vnion of the Spirit with God by Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Constant Praier:</hi> to the attaining vvhich <hi>Diuine End,</hi> all things practiſed in Religion doe diſpoſe: and to vvhich alone ſo great impediments are found in the vvorld.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The beſt generall <hi>proofe</hi> therfore <hi>of a good Call to</hi> Religion <hi>is a Loue to prayer,</hi> either vocall or Mentall. For if at firſt it be only to <hi>vocall Praier,</hi> by reaſon that the ſoule is ignorant of the efficacy and Excellency of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Contemplatiue Prayer, or perhaps has receiued ſome preiudices againſt it: Yet if she obſerue Solitude carefully, and vvith attention and feruour practiſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Praier, she vvill in time either by a Diuine Light perceiue the neceſſity of ioyning Mentall Praier to her vocall, or be enabled <hi>to practiſe her vocall Prayer mentally,</hi> vvhich is a ſublime Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It is a ſtate therfore of <hi>Recollectednes</hi> &amp; <hi>Introuerſion</hi> that euery one entring into Religion is to aſpire vnto. The vvhich conſiſts in an habituall Diſpoſition of ſoule, vvherby she tranſcends all creatures &amp; their Images, the vvhich therby come to haue litle or no Dominion ouer her: ſo that she remaines apt for immediate Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48407:115"/> vvith God, receiuing his Inſpirations, and by a returne, and as it vvere a refluxe tending to him and Operating to his Glory. It is called <hi>Recollectednes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soule in ſuch a State gathers her thoughts, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diſperſed &amp; fixed vvith multiplicity on Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and vnites them vpon God. And it is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſion,</hi> both becauſe the Spirit &amp; thoſe things which concerne it, being the only obiect that a deuout Soule conſiders &amp; values, she turnes all her Sollicitudes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> to obſerue defects, wants or inordinations there, to the end she may remedy, ſupply &amp; correct them: And likevviſe becauſe the proper Seate, the Throne &amp; Kingdome vvhere God by his Holy Spirit dvvells and reignes, is <hi>the pureſt Summity of Mans Spirit.</hi> There it is that the ſoule moſt perfectly enioyes and contemplates God, though euery vvhere, as in regard of himſelfe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually preſent, yet in regard of the communication of his Perfections preſent there after a far more Noble manner then in any part of the vvorld beſides, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he communicates to the Spirit of Man, as much of his Infinite Perfections, as any Creature is capable of: being not only ſimple <hi>Being,</hi> as he is to inanimate Bodies; or <hi>Life,</hi> as to liuing Creatures: or <hi>Perception</hi> as to ſenſitiue: or <hi>knowledge,</hi> as to other ordinary Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Soules: But vvith and beſides all theſe, he is <hi>a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Light, Purity &amp; happines,</hi> by communicating the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Graces of his Holy Spirit to the Spirits of his ſeruants. Hence it is that <hi>our Sauiour</hi> ſayes, <hi>(Regnum Dei intra vos est) The Kingdome of God is within you;</hi> And therfore it is that Religious, Solitary &amp; abſtracted Soules
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48407:115"/> doe endeauour to turne all their thoughts invvard, raiſing them to <hi>(Apicem Spiritus) the pure top of the Spirit</hi> (far aboue all ſenſible Phantaſmes, or imaginatiue diſcourſings, or groſſer Affections) vvhere God is moſt perfectly ſeene, and moſt comfortably enioyed.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Novv the actuall practiſe of this <hi>Introuerſion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts principally if not only, in the Exerciſe of Pure, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſpirituall Prayer: the Perfection of vvhich ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be the Cheife ayme to vvhich a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Contemplatiue Soule is obliged to aſpire. So that ſurely it is a great miſtake to thinke that the <hi>Spirit of S.

But it is not for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification</hi> of others that a Monaſticall State vvas inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ought to be vndertaken. Religious Soules truly Monaſticall flye the ſight of the vvorld, entring into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts and ſolitudes, to ſpend their liues alone in <hi>Pennance</hi> and <hi>Recollection,</hi> and to purify their ovvne Soules, not to giue Example or Inſtruction to others. Such <hi>Solitudes,</hi> are, or ought to be ſought by them, therby to diſpoſe themſelues for another far more proffitable <hi>Internall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi> in vvhich, Creatures being banished, the only Conuerſation is betvveene God and the Soule her ſelfe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48407:116"/> in the depth of the Spirit, as if beſides them tvvo, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing vvere exiſtent.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To gaine this happy ſtate a deuout Soule enters into Religion, vvhere all imaginable aduantages are to be found for this End: At leaſt anciently they vvere ſo, and ſtill ought to be. But yet though all Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to aſpire to the Perfection of this State, it is really gained by very fevv in theſe times. For ſome through ignorance, or miſinſtruction by Teachers that knovv no deeper not a more perfect introuerſion, then into the Internall ſenſes or imagination: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers through negligence, or elſe by reaſon of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary povvring forth their Affections &amp; thoughts vpon vanities, vſeleſſe Studies, or other ſenſuall Entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are neuer able perfectly to enter into their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and to find God there.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But it is vvonderfull to reade of that depth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collectednes &amp; moſt profound Introuerſion to vvhich ſome Ancient Solitary Religious Perſons by long exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſpirituall Prayer haue come: In ſo much as they haue bene ſo abſorpt &amp; euen drovvned in a deepe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God, that they haue not ſeene vvhat their eyes looked on, nor felt vvhat othervviſe vvould grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly hurt them.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48407:116"/> ſvvallovved vp, as to looſe in a ſort all other vſe. A moſt happy ſtate: in vvhich the Deuill cannot ſo much as fixe a ſeducing tentation or Image in their minds to diſtract them from God: but on the contrary, if he should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, that vvould be an occaſion to plunge them deeper &amp; more intimely into God.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And this vvas the effect of Pure, Spirituall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue Prayer: The vvhich vvas not only practiſed by the Holy Ancient Hermites &amp;c. in moſt ſublime Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: But the exerciſe therof vvas their Chiefe, moſt proper &amp; almoſt continuall Employment: in ſo much as the Perfection therof, vvas by them accounted the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their State.

                        <p n="12">12. What great aduantages the Ancient Hermites &amp; other Religious Perſons enioyed for the more certaine and more ſpeedy attaining to this Internall Purity of Praier &amp; vvonderfull Cleannes of Spirit (the End of their Profeſſion:) Hovv much more able their bodily complexions vvere to ſupport that moſt rigorous Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, thoſe long continued Attentions of mind &amp;c: And how much more efficacious herto were their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall labours</hi> beyond our Employments in <hi>Study:</hi> And laſtly how by ſuch like meanes they vvith <hi>the only Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

                        <p n="13">13. In this place I vvill content my ſelfe vvith shevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the Rule of <hi>our Holy Father S. Benedict,</hi> all his Diſciples are obliged to propoſe to themſelues no other End of their Religious Profeſſion, but only ſuch Purity both of ſoule, and the Operations of it in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Praier: So that hovv exact ſoeuer they be in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard Obſeruances, vnleſſe they be referd vnto, and efficacious alſo for the producing of this Internall Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſome reaſonable meaſure, they shall not be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by God to haue complied vvith their vocation and Profeſſion.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. To this purpoſe vvee may obſerue, that it is from thoſe Ancient Holy Hermites &amp; Religious that <hi>our Holy Father</hi> borrovved the greateſt part of his <hi>Rule</hi> and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, vvhich in the <hi>Concluſion</hi> he profeſſes to be meant only by him as a diſpoſition vvherby vvee may be enabled to imitate them in their moſt perfect Internall practiſes. It is from them that he borrovves the Phraſe of <hi>(Oratio pura) Pure Praier</hi> (in the 20. Chap.) The Exerciſe vvherof, beſides the reciting of the Office, he appointed daily, as appeares both by the ſame <hi>Chapter of the Rule,</hi> and alſo by the Story related by <hi>S. Gregory</hi> of one of his Monks, vvhom the Deuill in the shape of a Blackmore tempted out of the Community in the time of ſuch Recollections. By vvhich may be perceiued the great fruit and efficacy of ſuch Praier: For the Deuill could be contented he should be preſent at the Office,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48407:118"/> becauſe during that Exerciſe he could more eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract his mind: But knovving the force of Internall Prayer, hovv recollectiue it is, and vvhat light it affords to diſcouer the invvard Defects of the ſoule, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Grace to correct them: His principall aime vvas to vvithdravv him from ſo proffitable an Exerciſe. And therfore to countermine the Deuills Malice, <hi>Our Holy Father</hi> thought it vvorth a iourney expreſſely to cure the Infirmity and preuent the danger of one of his Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Monkes.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. For this End it is, that <hi>our Holy Father</hi> in the 58. C. ordeines <hi>Superiours</hi> in the Examination of the Spirits &amp; diſpoſitions of Nevv-comers, that they should moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially haue an eye to this moſt neceſſary condition, <hi>(Si Deum vere quaerit:) If he be ſuch an one as truly ſeekes God.</hi> And more particulary, <hi>(Si ſollicitùs eſt ad opus Dei:) If he haue a ſollicitous care duely to performe the worke of God,</hi> vvhich he interprets to be <hi>Praier:</hi> and this ſo principall a vvorke, that he ordeines, that <hi>(Nihil operi Dei praeponatur,) nothing must be preferred before it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">16. For the aduancing of this Praier, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch as is ſuitable to a Contemplatiue State, all other Exteriour Obſeruances are appointed. 1. By the 12. <hi>Degrees of Humility, by frequent Proſtrations, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of Secret Imperfections &amp;c.</hi> Pride, ſelfeloue &amp; all other our corrupt Affections hindring our vnion in Spirit vvith God are ſubdued &amp; expelled, and (as our <hi>Holy Father</hi> ſays at the end of the laſt Degree) <hi>that Perfect Charity</hi> vvhich moſt immediatly vnites the

By Faſtings, watchings</hi> &amp; other <hi>Auſterities,</hi> ſenſuality is mortified. <hi>4. By Religious Pouerty</hi> all diſtracting cares about temporall things are expelled. 5.

All this ſurely for no other end but that ſoules might be brought to a fit diſpoſition to imitate thoſe ſolitary and deuout <hi>Saints</hi> (propoſed by <hi>our holy Father</hi> for our examples) in their continuall conuerſation vvith God, attending to his Diuine inſpirations, and vn-interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnion of Spirit vvith him by pure Spirituall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Therfore though <hi>our Holy law-giuer</hi> doth not in his <hi>Rule</hi> giue his Diſciples any ſpeciall Inſtructions for ordering their <hi>Interiour</hi> ſpirituall Prayer (touching ſuch matters <hi>referring them to the Inſpiration of the Diuine Spirit,</hi> as himſelfe ſayth; as likevviſe to the Aduices of the Ancient fathers and Hermites profeſſing Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) Yet it is euident that his principall deſigne vvas to diſpoſe his Diſciples by his Ordinances to aſpire and attaine to ſuch Internall Perfection; vvithout vvhich the Externall Obſeruances vvould be of no value, but rather (being finally reſted in, vvithout farther applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Spirit) empty Hypocriticall Formalities. And more particularly as touching <hi>the Conferences of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48407:119"/> Fathers</hi> (written by <hi>Caſsian,</hi> and expreſſely recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs by <hi>our Holy Father</hi>) wee reaſonably may and ought to iudge that his intention vvas, wee should in a ſpeciall manner make vſe of the Inſtructions and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples there deliuered by prudent, holy and experienced <hi>Contemplatiues,</hi> as <hi>a Rule</hi> and <hi>Patterne,</hi> to vvhich vvee should conforme our ſelues, principally in our Internall Exerciſes: as being much more vſefull and proper for vs, then any Inſtructions about ſuch matters to be found in the <hi>writings</hi> of <hi>others</hi> far more learned <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church,</hi> vvho generally direct their ſpeeches to ſuch as leade common liues in the vvorld.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. This obligation being ſo manifeſt and vnqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: hovv can thoſe <hi>new Interpreters</hi> of our <hi>holy Rule</hi> be excuſed that; extend the Profeſſion of a Religious Perſon no further then to the performance of exteriour Obediences and obſeruances litterally expreſſed in the Rule, or ſignified by the expreſſe commands of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours? Surely they forget that it is <hi>to God</hi> only that vvee make <hi>our Vowes,</hi> and not to man, but only as his ſubſtitute, and as appointed by him to take care of the purifying our ſoules. For the deſtroying therfore of ſo vnreaſonable an Interpretation (yet too likely to be embraced by the tepide Spirits of this Age,) it vvill ſuffiſe only to looke vpon <hi>the forme of a Religious Profeſsion</hi> inſtituted by our holy Father in the 58. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in theſe words, <hi>Suſcipiendus autem, in Oratorio</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Let him that is to be receiued to a Religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion; promiſe in the preſence of the whole Community aſsembled in the Church, before God and his Saints;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48407:119"/> 1. A constant Stability in that ſtate. 2. A conuerſion of his Manners, 3. and Obedience.</hi> Now of the three things ſo, ſolemnely and vvith ſuch affrighting circumſtances, vovved, <hi>Conuerſion of Manners</hi> can ſignify no other thing but Internall Purity of the ſoule; <hi>Obedience</hi> indeed ſeemes to regard the outvvard obſeruances of the Rule: yet ſurely vvith an eye to the principall end of all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall duties of all Chriſtians, and much more of thoſe that aſpire to the Perfection of Diuine Loue. And as for <hi>Stability,</hi> it regards both theſe, adding to them a perſeuerance and a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall progreſſe in both to the end.</p>
                        <p n="19">19.

                        <p n="20">
                           <pb n="188" facs="tcp:48407:120"/>20. Againe vvhen ſuch <hi>condeſcending Interpreters</hi> doe further ſay, that all our obligation by vertue of a Religious Profeſſion, is to be vnderſtood only <hi>(Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Regulam,) according to the Rule:</hi> We muſt knovv that this Phraſe <hi>(Secundum Regulam)</hi> is to be annexed to <hi>the Vow of Obedience</hi> only, importing that a Religious Superiour hath not a vaſt vnlimited authority, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Rule: vvheras there are no limits preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Conuerſion of manners,</hi> to Chriſtian Holines and Perfection: in vvhich vve are obliged daily to make a further progreſſe. To the vvhich Duty, as by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religious vvee haue a greater obligation ſo likevviſe haue vvee a greater neceſſity. For though by entring into Religion vvee doe auoyde many occaſions and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to outvvard enormous ſins: yet vvee can neuer be freed from our thoughts, vvhich vvill purſue vs vvhere euer vvee are: and more impetuouſly and dangerouſly in ſolitude, then in company, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greateſt pleaſure of man, vvhether they be good or bad. For in Solitude the ſoule hath her vvhole free ſcope vvithout interruption to purſue her thoughts. So that a Religious perſon that can thinke himſelfe not obliged, and that actually doth not reſtreine and order his thoughts, by diuerting and fixing them on Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Diuine obiects, Such an one if for vvant of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he guard himſelfe from outvvard, Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous crimes: yet he vvill more &amp; more deeply plunge himſelfe in corrupt nature, contracting a greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity &amp; incapacity of Diuine Grace daily: And ſuch invvard Deordinations vvill become more dangerous
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48407:120"/> and incurable, then if he had liued in the vvorld, vvhere there are ſo frequent diuerſions. Novv a poore and moſt ineffectuall Remedy againſt theſe vvill he find in an exact conformity to any externall obſeruances vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: yea perhaps they vvill ſerue to increaſe ſuch ill habits of ſoule, by breeding Pride and ſecurity in it.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. A much better and more proffitable <hi>Interpreter</hi> of our <hi>holy Rule</hi> therfore is <hi>Deuout S.

The kingdome of God is within you: that is, it conſists not outwardly in the fashion of our cloathes or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our corporall Dyet, but in the vertues of our inner man. But you will ſay: What? doeſt thou ſo inforce vpon vs ſpirituall Dutyes, as that thou condemneſt a care of the externall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces enioyned by the Rule of S.

But otherwiſe, when it shall happen that one of theſe two muſt be omitted: in ſuch caſe theſe are much rather to be omitted, then thoſe former.

                        </p>
                        <p n="22">22. Neither vvill it auaile the forementioned <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to ſay, that their meaning is not to preiudice the obligation of Religious Perſons to internall Duties: but only to shevv that ſuch obligation is grounded on the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48407:121"/> Diuine Lavv impoſed on them as Chriſtians; and not on an Externall Lavv made by man and voluntarily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone.

                        <p n="23">23. And from vvhat hath bene ſayd may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this moſt true and proffitable <hi>Obſeruation,</hi> to witt, That vvhoſoeuer vvould attempt the reſtoring of the true Spirit of Religion (which is Contemplation) miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably decayed in theſe dayes, vvill labour in vaine if he thinke to compaſſe his holy Deſigne by multiplying of Ceremonies, inlargeing of Offices, increaſing of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Auſteritys, rigorous regulating of Dyet and Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences &amp;c.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. OVR obligation therfore to tend to Perfect Internall Purity &amp; Simplicity being ſo great &amp; ſo vndiſpenſable: vvhat account, thinke vvee, vvill ſome Religious Perſons be able to giue to Almighty God for their miſerable deficienty in this ſo eſſentiall a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Religion</hi> is by all acknowledged for <hi>a ſtate of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> not that by the mere taking a Religious Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Habit a Perſon is therby more Perfect then he vvas before: but becauſe by renouncing thoſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue Impediments vvhich are in the vvorld, he puts himſelfe into a condition, in vvhich he not only may far more eaſily aſpire to the Perfection of Diuine Loue: but moreouer by aſſuming ſuch a ſtate he obliges himſelfe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48407:122"/> to employ all thoſe aduantages vvhich he finds in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as meanes to approach nearer to this Perfection dayly, more then if he had continued in the vvorld he either could or vvas obliged. The vvhich if he doe not, he vvill be ſo far from enioying any Priuiledge in Gods ſight by the Perfection of his State, as that he will be accountable to God ſo much the more for his ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and negligence in making vſe of ſuch aduantages and Talents giuen him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>S. Paulinus</hi> excellently illuſtrates this Truth by this <hi>ſimilitude.</hi> He compares <hi>the world</hi> to a dry ſcorched and barren vvildernes: and <hi>Celeſtiall Happines</hi> to a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Paradice, diuided from this deſart by a deepe and tempeſtuous riuer, vvhich muſt neceſſarily be paſt by ſwimming: The ſecureſt way to paſſe ouer this riuer is by quitting ones cloathes: But fevv there are that haue the courage to expoſe themſelues to the iniuries of the weather for a while, and therfore aduenture ouer cloathes and all: And of them, God knovvs, a vvorld miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by the vvay. Some fevv others (ſuch are <hi>Religious Perſons</hi>) ſeeing this danger take a good Reſolution to deueſt themſelues of their Cloathes, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues lighter and nimbler by caſting avvay all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hovv deare ſoeuer to flesh and blood. But yet this being done, it remaines that they should labour, naked as they are, vvith ſvvimming to paſſe the Riuer: But this they neglect to doe, or take ſo little paines, and ſtriue ſo negligently againſt the vvaues and ſtreame, that all they doe comes to nothing, they are in as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and as far from Paradice as they vvere before. And
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48407:123"/> vvhereas they glorify themſelues becauſe they are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: that vvill rather aggrauate their folly and make their negligence far more culpable, in that having ſo great an advantage, they vvould not take a little paines to doe that for vvhich they caſt of their Cloathes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Novv the <hi>Impediments</hi> either much delaying, or quite hindring many ſoules that liue in Religion, and are naturally apt enough for the Exerciſes of a Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue Life, from complying vvith this moſt neceſſary obligation, are <hi>partly in</hi> the <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> in the <hi>will.</hi> Concerning this latter, vvhich is <hi>Selfe-Loue,</hi> a ſetled Affection to Creatures, negligence &amp;c. much hath already bene ſayd, and more vvill hereafter be added. But concerning the other impediment ſeated in the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> which is <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the true way leading to that perfection vvhich is the proper End of a Religious Contemplatiue Life, I vvill here take into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Whether, and how far ſuch Ignorance may excuſe a Religious Perſon that does not aſpire to that Perfection to which his State obliges him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. For the clearing of this <hi>Doubt,</hi> vvee may obſerue that there may in this caſe be <hi>a twofold Ignorance.</hi> 1. An <hi>Ignorance</hi> in groſſe that there is any ſuch Obligation. 2. On ſuppoſition that a ſoule is informed that she hath ſuch an obligation, <hi>an Ignorance</hi> of the meanes and vvayes proper and neceſſary for the acquiring of this Perfection: the vvhich in the preſent caſe are <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and (principally) <hi>Internall Prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Firſt therfore for the former ſort of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> it is ſo groſſe and euen vvillfull, that there can ſcarce be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48407:123"/> imagined any <hi>Excuſe</hi> or qualification for it. For vvhat other thought can a Soule haue quitting the vvorld, and all the pleaſures and commodities therin to embrace Pouerty, Obedience, ſolitude &amp;c, but therby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate herſelfe entirely to God, shevved by the <hi>Solemne circumſtances of her Admiſsion</hi> and <hi>Profeſsion,</hi> the <hi>Queſtions propoſed to her,</hi> and <hi>her Anſwers, her Habit, Tonſure, Repreſentation of a Death and Buriall, Solemne Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of her Habit, and Prayers of the Community</hi> &amp;c? All that are vvitneſſes and Spectatours of ſuch an Action doe no othervviſe vnderſtand it: And indeed except it vvere ſo, vvhat difference is there betvveene a <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Religious state?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. But in the next place touching the <hi>ſecond ſort of Ignorance,</hi> to vvit, of the vvayes moſt proper and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to bring a Religious Soule to Perfection: It is to be feared that ſuch an Ignorance vvill be but a ſmall Excuſe, and that but to very fevv. For ſince both Faith and Experience teach vs vvith vvhat great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, vvhat inordinate Affections &amp;c. vvee enter into Religion, vvith an intention there to abate and mortify them: And ſince euen naturall Reaſon &amp; dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience likevviſe shevv vs, that Perfection of the Soule cannot conſiſt in Externall obſeruances, vvhich doe not penetrate into the Interiour: Yea vvithout Prayer and Purity of intention (to be had only by Prayer) they doe rather nourish Selfeloue and Selfe eſteeme: ſince thirdly the ſame experience conuinces vs that ſuch vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prayers as vvee vſe and ioyne to our other Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances doe not produce in vs a ſufficient Purification
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48407:124"/> of Soule: no nor that any other painefull <hi>methods of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> (vnknovvne to the Ancient Contemplatiues) doe afford vs ſufficient Light and Grace for ſuch a purpoſe, becauſe they peirce not deepe enough into the Spirit: vvhat reaſonable ſoule but vvill hence conclude, that there muſt needs be ſome other efficacious meanes for the acquiring of the end vvhich vvee propoſe to our ſelues. And ſince God vvill infallibly giue Light and Grace to all thoſe that haue recourſe vnto him in Spirit and Truth: It muſt neceſſarily follovv, that the only cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ground of ſuch <hi>Ignorance</hi> muſt needs be a neglect of ſuch Prayer: And the roote of ſuch neglect, a <hi>ſenſuall tepide diſpoſition of the will,</hi> hating to raiſe it ſelfe to God. And let any one iudge vvhether <hi>an Ignorance ſo groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> can excuſe vs: Eſpecially conſidering, that <hi>our Holy Father,</hi> requires the practiſe of ſuch Prayer in all our ſmalleſt vndertakings, and teaches vs that his Rule is only a preparation to Perfection, he referres vs further to the examples of the Ancient Hermites, vvhoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Prayer if vvee vvould imitate, vvee should make ſome approaches at leaſt to that Perfection, to the almoſt inconceiuable Sublimity and purity vvherof they attained.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Novv if <hi>Ignorance</hi> vvill not be a ſufficient excuſe to any Religious Perſon for either not endeuouring after Interiour Purity of ſoule by Prayer in ſpirit, or endeuouring after a vvrong improper manner &amp; vvay: Hovv much leſſe excuſable, nay hovv deeply culpable before God vvill thoſe be, vvho are ſufficiently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the only true internall vvayes leading to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48407:124"/> &amp; vvithall are furnished vvith all helpes, leaſure &amp; aduantages for that purpoſe: &amp; yet out of a ſetled ſlothfullnes, &amp; fixed loue to ſenſuall obiects haue not the courage or vvill to vvalke in them: yea perhaps hauing once comfortably vvalked in them, doe moſt ingratefully &amp; perfidiouſly forſake &amp; turne out of them? Reaping no other benefit by their knovvledge, but perhaps an ability to talke of them, to the helpe of others, it may be, but to the encreaſing of their ovvne Pride, &amp; ſelfe-loue: ſo that their knovvledge of their obligation &amp; end of their Profeſſion helpes to leade them further from it.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But aboue all moſt miſerable vvill their condition be, vvho liuing in Contemplatiue Orders, &amp; not hauing either ſufficient knovvledge or Grace to practiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the exerciſes of true Internall Prayer &amp; Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life, shall deterre others therefrom, &amp; diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or perhaps perſecute thoſe vvhom God hath inſpired to renevv the only proper exerciſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: The decay of vvhich has bene the decay of the true Spirit of Monaſticall Religion.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. True it is that to iuſtify ſuch vndue proceedings &amp; to gaine an eſteeme to their ovvne inferiour Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, partiality has ſuggeſted to them certaine <hi>ſeeming reaſons</hi> &amp; pretences againſt the practiſe of <hi>Contemplatiue Prayer,</hi> &amp; if <hi>it were dangerous,</hi> &amp; did expoſe the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſers of it to illuſions: or as if it were <hi>preiudiciall to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular obſeruances</hi> &amp; obedience: or that perhaps it may <hi>diminish the credit</hi> vvhich ſome Religious Orders haue gained in the vvorld by their long ſolemne Offices,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48407:125"/> laboriously celebrated. But (as I shall in due place in the <hi>laſt Treatiſe</hi> demonſtrate) all theſe accuſations made againſt Contemplatiue Prayer, are moſt vniuſt and groundleſſe. On the contrary thoſe that practiſe ſuch Prayer as they ought, are moſt carefull of conformity to Religious Duties, &amp; eſpecially the Diuine office appointed by the Church: And this out of conſcience &amp; vvith great purity of intention.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Indeed <hi>true Internall liuers</hi> are not very ſollicitous for gaining credit &amp; eſteeme vvith the vvorld; &amp; much leſſe vvould they make that an end of their Religious obſeruances. On the contrary their cordiall deſire is to liue vnknovvn &amp; excluded from the vvorld, approuing their ſoules to God only. Neither are they forvvard to vſurpe offices abroad not belonging to them, as of <hi>Preaching, Hearing Confeſsions of ſeculars</hi> &amp;c: by vvhich the moſt neceſſary ſolitude &amp; Recollectednes, vvhich by their Profeſſion ought to be priſed aboue all things, are interrupted, &amp; oft vtterly deſtroyed. And the more confidently doe they expreſſe a zeale for theſe eſſentiall things, as being aſſured that God vvill not be vvanting to ſupply them ſufficiently vvith all things neceſſary to their corporall ſuſtenance, as long as they preferre the care of Purifying their ſoules, &amp; complying vvith the obligations of their Profeſſion before ſuch inferiour things. <hi>S. Anthony</hi> vvas ſo carefull of preſeruing this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſolitude &amp; diſingagement from all treating vvith the vvorld, that he forbids <hi>his Monkes</hi> to <hi>enter into Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches frequented by multitudes:</hi> And much leſſe vvould he ſuffer them to inuite &amp; call <hi>Seculars</hi> into their ovvne
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48407:125"/> Churches. And <hi>S. Stephen of Grammont</hi> vpon experience of vvhat extreme preiudice the ſpirit of Religion had receiued by neglecting a ſolitary abſtracted life, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids his Diſciples in his Rule to haue publick Churches, or to admitt into their Oratories the preſence of ſeculars, or ſo much as to let them take Holy-water home with them: Or to quit their Deſart to preach to others.</hi> He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands them <hi>to auoyd Confraternities: &amp;c:</hi> And to preuent complaints &amp; feares leaſt by ſo rigorous a ſequeſtration from the vvorld they should be in danger of Penury: He moſt aſſuredly proteſts vnto them, that it is impoſſible that God should neglect to prouide for them, that for his ſake quitt all pretentions to the vvorld.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. But the true cauſe of bitternes shevved by ſome againſt Internall Prayer (reſtored by ſeuerall moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated &amp; Glorious Saints in theſe latter times) may be feared to proceed partly from ſome kind of Pride &amp; an vnwillingneſſe to acknovvledge any Religious Exerciſes to be more perfect then thoſe, practiſed ſo long by themſelues: or to ſee that povver vvhich they had gained in the managing of the Conſciences of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Perſons &amp;c: to be in danger of ceaſing.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. To conclude this Point: Thoſe that place perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Religious Profeſſion in any thing but in the Purity &amp; ſimplicity of ſpirit, ſuch may call themſelues <hi>Monkes</hi> &amp; <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatiues,</hi> being yet able to shevv no ſignes of ſuch a Profeſſion but the <hi>habit,</hi> &amp; a certaine outvvard, formall, ſolemne &amp; ſeuere comportment, vnder vvhich may be hidden a ſecret moſt profound ſelfe loue &amp; Pride. And they may doe vvell to meditate ſeriouſly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48407:126"/> on that memorable ſaying of <hi>Heſychius,</hi> a holy illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Monke, <hi>He that hath renounced the world</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is, mariage, poſſeſsions &amp; the like: ſuch an one indeed hath made the Exteriour man a Monke: but not, as yet the Interiour. But he that hath renounced his owne thoughts &amp; affections: ſuch an one hath made truly the Interiour man a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Monke alſo. And verily any one that hath neuer ſo ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire therunto, may eaſily make the outward man a Monke: But it is a taske of no ſmall labour to make the Interiour man ſo too. Now a Signe of an Interiour Monke</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is the hauing attained to the Dignity of Pure ſpirituall Prayer.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>§. 1. That Internall Prayer was the Practiſe of Ancient Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits: what kind of Prayer that was.</p>
                           <p>§. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. How it to came to paſſe that vocall Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to them Internall, &amp; brought many ſoules anciently to Perfection: And why it will not now doe ſo ordinarily.</p>
                           <p>§. 7. 8. 9. 10. The great helpe that the Ancients found by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall labours, to bring them to Recollection.</p>
                           <p>§. 11. 12. 13. How manuall labours came to giue place to Studies: that which are defended.</p>
                           <p>§. 14. The late Practiſe of Internall Prayer recompences other Defects.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THAT <hi>Internall Spirituall Prayer</hi> vvas ſeriouſly &amp; almoſt <hi>continually practiſed</hi> by the <hi>Ancients</hi> is appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both out of the <hi>Liues &amp; Conferences of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48407:126"/> fathers.</hi> But indeed there are but fevv proofes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that appointed times vvere ſet for the exerciſing it <hi>Conuentually,</hi> except in the fore-mencioned <hi>story</hi> of the <hi>Monke</hi> tempted by the Deuill to retire himſelfe from his Brethren vvhen they vvere in ſuch Prayer. I ſuppoſe therfore that <hi>Superiours</hi> &amp; Directours of ſoules tending to Contemplation vvere in theſe latter dayes obliged to enioyne <hi>dayly Recollections,</hi> by reaſon that the dayly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate &amp; continuall employments of Religious Perſons are not ſo helpfull &amp; aduantagious to the procuring of that moſt neceſſary <hi>ſimplicity</hi> &amp; purity of ſoule, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently they vvere: And therfore they vvere forced to make ſome ſupply for this defect, by ſuch Conuentuall Recollections: The vvhich they inſtituted to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in publick, becauſe they perceiued or feared that Religious ſoules, if they vvere left to themſelues, vvould out of Tepidity neglect a duty ſo neceſſary, &amp; ſo efficacious.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now to the end that by comparing the manner of liuing obſerued anciently by Religious Perſons vvith the Moderne in theſe dayes, it may appeare vvhat great aduantages they enioyed tovvards the attaining of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Prayer beyond vs; Wee may conſider. 1.

                        <p n="4">4. Novv how it came to paſſe that <hi>vocall Prayers alone</hi> vvere in ancient times <hi>auaileable to bring ſoules to perfect Contemplation,</hi> vvhich in theſe dayes it neither does, nor ordinarily ſpeaking, candoe: I shall declare more fully vvhen I come herafter to treat of Prayer: And in this place I vvill content my ſelfe to poynt only at the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; grounds of difference: viz: 1. <hi>One Reaſon</hi> vvas their incomparably more abſtraction of life, more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous ſolitude &amp; almoſt perpetuall ſilence, of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of vvhich in theſe dayes (it is beleiued) vvee are not capable. 2. <hi>A ſecond</hi> vvas their faſts, Abſtinences &amp; other auſterities beyond the ſtrength of our infirme corporall complexions. 3. <hi>A third</hi> vvas their Externall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the ſet times of Prayer, the vvhich did far better diſpoſe ſoules to Recollection, to Attendance on the Diuine Inſpirations &amp;c: then thoſe ordinarily practiſed in theſe dayes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. No wonder then if <hi>vocall Prayer</hi> exerciſed by ſuch Pure, reſigned, humble, Mortified, &amp; vndiſtracted ſoules had the efficacy to produce in them an habituall ſtate of Recollected Introuerſion: vvhich doubtles in many of them vvas more profound, not only vvhilſt they vvere buſied in their vocall Exerciſes, but alſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Externall buſines, then it is ordinarily vvith
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48407:127"/> vs in the height of our beſt Recollections.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But a more large handling of this matter I referre to the laſt <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> vvhere vvee ſpeake purpoſely of <hi>Prayer:</hi> And for the preſent I vvill only take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the third forenamed aduantage of <hi>corporall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> vvhich to the Ancients proued a helpe to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation far more efficacious, then the generall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religious in theſe dayes.</p>
                        <p n="7">7.

                        <p n="14">14.

                        <p n="15">15. Novv though as hath bene ſayd, ſuch a change hath bene after this manner made in the externall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of Religious perſons: Yet ſtill the ſame eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall indiſpenſable <hi>obligation of aſpiring to Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> remaines: For the attaining to vvhich although ſtudies ioyned vvith Prayer ſeeme in ſome regards to be leſſe aduantageous then anciently ſuch labours as the Aegyptian Monkes &amp;c. vndertooke, were: Yet it hath pleaſed God in goodnes to his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in a good meaſure to recompence that diſaduantage, by raiſing vp ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Holy perſons to teach more accurately then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the knovvledge and practiſe of pure, Internall, Contemplatiue Prayer. For ſince it cannot be denyed, that to perſons far more diſtracted by ſtudies then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently they vvere by labours (vvhich did not hinder a moderate quiet attention to God) Vocall Prayer though neuer ſo much prolonged has not (ordinarily ſpeaking) ſufficient force to recollect the mind habitually, or to ſuppreſſe and cure the many inordinate Affections of corrupt nature: Hence it is that the vſe of <hi>appointed daily Recollections</hi> hath ſeemed to be of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; vvithout vvhich the Spirit of Contemplation vvould be quite loſt.

Therfore that Superiour that does not find himſelfe more vvilling to giue vp his place, then to retaine it, ought to ſuſpect that he is ſcarce in a good ſtate.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. From vvhich teſtimony and authority, yea euen from the light of <hi>Naturall Reaſon,</hi> vvee may firmely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>the Spirit of Praier</hi> is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to a Religious Superiour, that vvithout it he cannot exerciſe his charge proffitably either to himſelfe or his ſubiects: And conſequently, that to a Superiour in an Order vvhoſe ſpirit is Contemplation, it is neceſſary that he haue attained to a good eſtablished Habit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue Praier. For (as hath bene ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Diſcourſe, concerning Spirituall Guides) hovv can ſuch a Superiour vvithout knovvledge gained by experience, inculcate the ſo neceſſary Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection and Praier? Nay rather vvill he not be more likely to diſcountenance thoſe Exerciſes in vvhich he is not skilled, and from vvhich perhaps he has an auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Therfore that too ordinarily maintained Poſition of ſome, <hi>That Actiue Spirits are more fitt for Superiorities and Externall Emploiments, then Contemplatiue: which are to be left to the Solitude and Sequeſtration to which their Spirits incline them,</hi> is indeed moſt vnreaſonable &amp; groundles.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. On the contrary, no doubt there is, but that the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48407:131"/> decay of Religion hath principally proceeded from this prepoſterous diſorder, viz. that in moſt Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities Actiue Spirits haue gott the aduantage to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe themſelues of Prelatures and Spirituall Paſtour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships ouer the Contemplatiue, though the ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vvas inſtituted only for Contemplation. And this has happened euen ſince Contemplatiue Praier has bene reſtored by Perſons extraordinarily raiſed by God, as <hi>Ruſbrochius, Thaulerus, S. Tereſa</hi> &amp;c. ſo that Religious Communities haue bene ordered euen in the point of <hi>Spirituallity</hi> by Spirits of a quite different &amp; contrary temper to that for vvhich they vvere intended.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Indeed it is not to be vvondred at, that <hi>Actiue Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> should ſo preuaile: conſidering that thoſe vvho are truly <hi>of a Contemplatiue diſpoſition</hi> and deſigne, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well the difficulty and Danger of <hi>Superiority,</hi> how full of Extrouerſion, Diſtraction and Sollicitude it is, and vvhat occaſions and Tentations there are in it to raiſe, nourish, and ſatisfy ſenſuall Affections, Pride &amp;c. to the perill of extinguishing the Spirit of Praier (except in ſoules far aduanced in Praier and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:) ſuch I ſay, are therfore iuſtly afraid of, and doe vſe all lawfull meanes to auoide the Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of others. Whereas <hi>Actiue Spirits</hi> that liue in Religion, not being capable of ſuch Praier as will raiſe them much out of nature, haue not the like apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch Employments: But on the contrary being lead by naturall Deſires of Preeminence and loue of liberty; and beleiuing that thoſe who are true Internall Liuers will not ſubmit themſelues to all the vvaies &amp;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48407:132"/> Policies vſed for the increaſing the temporall Good of their Communities; doe not feare to offer themſelues, yea and ambitiouſly to ſeeke Dominion ouer others: <hi>falſely</hi> in the meane time perſvvading themſelues that their only <hi>Motiue</hi> is <hi>Charity,</hi> and a Deſire to promote the Glory of God, and the aduancement, both tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Spirituall, of their Conuents or Congregations. But vvhat the effect is, experience shevves.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. True it is that it cannot be auoyded, but that many <hi>vnfit ſpirits</hi> vvill oft be admitted into Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, very different from the diſpoſitions requiſite: (though it belongs to Superiours to prouide as vvell as may be againſt ſuch an abuſe:) But ſuch being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Actiue Diſpoſitions,</hi> the beſt vvere to employ them in <hi>Actiue Exerciſes</hi> &amp; Externall matters: as in the <hi>Offices of Procuration, Diſpenſe, Building</hi> and the like: <hi>But</hi> as for <hi>Prelacies,</hi> the <hi>Charge of Inſtructing Nouices,</hi> or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pertaining to the directing of ſoules, it is the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſpirit of Contemplation to employ Actiue Diſpoſitions in ſuch. For hovv can they vvithout light or Experience direct ſoules in vvaies vnknovven to themſelues, yea vvhich through ignorance or miſtake they perhaps diſapproue?</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Beſides vpon exact conſideration it vvill be found, that in the point of <hi>Gouernment, Contemplatiue Spirits</hi> that haue made a good progreſſe in Internall Praier, <hi>haue great aduantages</hi> aboue the <hi>Actiue.</hi> For ſuch being carefull themſelues to vſe all due Abſtraction, vvill leſſe moleſt themſelues and others vvith impertinent buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Not prying too narrowly into all paſſages, as if they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48407:132"/> ſought occaſion of shewing their authority and ability in making vnneceſſary reprehenſions, to the diſquieting of Communities: but for Peace ſake they vvill ſometimes euen <hi>ſilere a bonis,</hi> paſſing ouer many things vvhich doe ſeeme a litle amiſſe: vvherin they shevv great Prudence, and alſo cauſe much proffit to ſubiects. 2. Such being diligent about their ovvne Recollections, doe out of a loue to ſilence, Patience, &amp; Peace, forbeare the doing or impoſing of a multitude of vnneceſſary Taskes vpon others. 3. By meanes of Praier they obtaine light to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things to the benefit of their ſubiects ſoules. And in caſe they haue erred, or bene defectiue in any thing, they diſcouer, and amend it in their next Recollection. 4. In the manner and fashion of their vvhole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment a certaine <hi>Diuine Grace</hi> shines forth, vvhich is of great efficacy to vvinne their ſubiects Heartes to Obedience and Diuine Loue. 5. Yea if by Corporall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity they be diſabled to attend to many Externall Obſeruances, yet a vievv of the Patience, quietnes and Reſignation shevved by them, is more edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſoules vnder their Care, then all the moſt exact externall Regularities and Seuerity of Actiue Spirits. 6. Yea euen in regard of <hi>Temporall Benefit</hi> to Communities, Contemplatiue Spirits are more aduantageous then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue. Becauſe they not putting any confidence in their ovvne Induſtry, Prudence and Actiuity, but only in the Diuine Prouidence (vvhich is neuer vvanting to thoſe that for temporall regards vvill not doe any thing vnſeemely or misbecoming their Abſtracted ſtate) doe enioy the effects and bleſſings of God far more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48407:133"/> vvhilſt they preferre his loue and ſeruice before any humane, diſtracting ſollicitudes for outward things. Memorable Examples of great Bleſſings attending ſuch a Confidence in God vvee find abundantly in <hi>the Life of our holy Father</hi> and of the <hi>Ancient Monkes,</hi> and more lately in the life of <hi>Suſo, Ioannes de Cruce</hi> &amp;c. Novv the vvant of ſuch Confidence in Actiue Spirits proceedes merely from Defect in Diuine Loue, and <hi>that</hi> from the vvant of Internall Praier. And hence proceede hurtfull &amp; vnſeemely compliances vvith the vvorld, a regard rather to vvealth then good vvills to ſerue God in the ſoules that enter into Religion &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>A fearfull Example</hi> of the miſcheife follovving the neglect of Internall Praier in a Superiour, vvee find in <hi>Bernardinus Ochinus</hi> a Superiour in a moſt ſtrict Order, vvho vvas a famous Zealous Preacher, and as might be iudged by outvvard appearance, of more then ordinary Sanctity; yet vvithall to comply vvith thoſe outvvard Employments, a great <hi>neglecter of Internall Conuentuall Recollections.</hi> And vvhen he vvas ſometimes charitably admonished of ſuch his <hi>Tepidity,</hi> his ordinary anſvver vvas, <hi>Doe you not know, that he who is alwaies in a good Action, is alwaies in Praier.</hi> Which Saying of his had bene true, if ſuch good actions had bene performed in vertue of Praier, and by Grace obtained therby: For then they had bene vertually Praiers: Wheras Actions though in themſelues neuer ſo good, if they vvant that Purity of Intention, vvhich is only to be had by Pure Praier, are in Gods eſteeme of litle or no valevv: The principall motiues of them being no other then ſuch as

                           <p>§. 1. Superiours ought carefully to examine the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe that they admitt to Religion.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. NOw one of the principall Points of a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours Care for the vvellfare of his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity conſiſts in prouiding or admitting into it only ſuch Spirits and diſpoſitions, as are likely to promote the good of it, by liuing according to the Spirit of it. And in this all ſuch <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Counſellours</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to vvhom the lavves haue referred the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> and tryall of ſuch as offer themſelues to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular life, and are aftervvard, vpon their Approbation, to be <hi>Profeſſed:</hi> And a greater conſideration of this Point is more neceſſary in theſe daies, then ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly it was: For it is not now as in <hi>our holy Fathers time,</hi> vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incorrigible Perſons might be <hi>expelled</hi> the Congregation.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="217" facs="tcp:48407:134"/>2. It is not, I ſuppoſe, needfull to aduiſe ſuch as are in thoſe Offices to take care hovv they admitt <hi>looſe Spirits</hi> into Religion among them, vvho vvill not ſo much as intend God or his ſeruice: All vvhoſe Actions haue no other Motiue but either feare of Pennance or hope of gaining Reputation, Preferments &amp;c: Whoſe bodies are Priſoners in Religion, but their Minds and Deſires vvandring in the vvorld: Who muſt enioy all Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and corporall helpes equally vvith the beſt, yea and generally vſe them moſt vvaſtfully vvithout conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others: Who finding no taſt or contentment in Spirituall matters, are euen forced to ſeeke ſatisfaction in ſenſuall pleaſures, and for the paſſing of the time to frame Deſignes, to raiſe and maintaine factions, and this eſpecially againſt thoſe that they ſee doe moſt intend God, on vvhom they vvill caſt from of themſelues all the Burdens of a Regular life: Who vvill thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues excuſed from all Duties for the leaſt corporall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity: Who vvill deſire and endeauour to make others like themſelues, that their <hi>party</hi> and povver may be greater: Laſtly vvho reape ſo litle good to their ovvne ſoules, and are likely to doe ſo much preiudice to others, that probably it had bene much better for them to haue continued in the vvorld; the ſtate of Religion only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to encreaſe their guilt and miſery.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Such <hi>looſe Spirits</hi> are vvorſe in a Community vvhere the knovvledge of true Spirituality is common, then in other places: Becauſe there they are vvillfully naught, and doe reſiſt amendment. If by the ſeuerity of lavves and Conſtitutions they may come to be kept in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48407:135"/> ſome tolerable order, yet this reaches only to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, &amp; laſts no longer then the Superiours eyes are vpon them. And indeed the Superiours themſelues vvill in all probability feele the greateſt ſmart from ſuch vndue <hi>Admiſsions,</hi> being likely to find dayly great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes from their obſtinacy. Such <hi>looſe Spirits</hi> are the cauſe of ſuch a burdenſome <hi>multiplicity of Lawes,</hi> all vvhich notvvithſtanding are litle auayleable for their amendment, and <hi>yet doe abridge the due Liberty of Spirit</hi> neceſſary to deuout vvellminded Soules, nourishing Scrupuloſity &amp;c. in them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let the beſt care that is poſſible be vſed, notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome vnfit perſons vvill through eaſines, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affection or other reſpects in the <hi>Examiners,</hi> ſlip in. If therfore thoſe vvho are apparently bad be receiued, vvhat a Community vvill there be prouided? Many that ſeeme good, vvill proue bad: but ſeldome or neuer vvill thoſe that appeare bad, become good. God indeed can change the vvorſt: But yet an vncertaine hope in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Grace is not to be relyed vpon, eſpecially vvhere publick good is concerned.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Generally there is great <hi>feruour</hi> in Soules at their firſt entrance into Religion. Therfore if any one shevv vnrulines, Obſtinacy and Indeuotion during their Nouiceship, ſmall good is to be expected from them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A litle Deuoutnes vvill not ſerue to counteruaile ill inclinations to lying, diſſembling, factiouſnes, an humour of calummating &amp;c: For a great, and ſcarſe to be hoped for meaſure of Grace vvill be requiſite to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſuch pernicious Qualities. On the contrary <hi>a good
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48407:135"/> Nature,</hi> euen vvhere there is not ſo much Deuotion, yet vvill beare vp a Soule, and make her a tolerable member of a Community. It is likevviſe a great Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for Grace: vvhich it may vvell be hoped, vvill one day follovv, and that ſuch an one vvill become Deuout: Eſpecially this may be hoped for in thoſe that haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a good <hi>ſound Iudgment,</hi> vvhich is much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Novv by <hi>a good Nature</hi> I meane, not ſuch an one as is generally in the vvorld ſtiled ſo, to vvit, <hi>a facility</hi> and <hi>eaſines</hi> to grant a requeſt, or to comply vvith others. On the contrary, for as much as regards a Coenobiticall life, I account ſuch to be <hi>an ill nature,</hi> being eaſily ſeduced and peruerted. By <hi>a good Nature</hi> therefore in this place I meane ſuch an one as is indued vvith Modeſty, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Quietnes, Humility, Patience, loue of Truth, and other ſuch Morally good Qualities, vvhich are good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for Chriſtian Perfection. Novv a perſon of an <hi>ill Nature</hi> that vvill make a good shevv, out of hope to ſteale <hi>a Profeſsion,</hi> ought the rather for his diſſimulation to be reiected.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And indeed <hi>Subtile Natures</hi> are much to be taken heede of. Some <hi>Nouices</hi> vvill behaue themſelues ſo cunningly, as at the end of their <hi>Probation,</hi> none can be able to produce any ſpeciall accuſation againſt them, &amp; yet they may in their conſcience beleiue them to be vnfitt. In this caſe euery one is to follovv their ovvne iudgement: And eſpeciall heede is to be taken of the iudgement of the <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Miſtriſse of the Nouices,</hi> who are moſt to be credited, as hauing the opportunity &amp;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48407:136"/> meanes to eſpy and penetrate more deeply into their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Diſpoſitions.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. This <hi>Goodnes,</hi> or <hi>vertuouſnes of Nature</hi> is an Eſſentiall Point, and farre more to be regarded then thoſe <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall</hi> ones, as ſtrength of Bodily complexion, Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Wit, Gracefullnes of Behauiour, skill in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Nobility, Portion &amp;c. And particularly for this laſt, hovv far Religious Soules ought to be from regarding riches or gaine in matters of this Nature, or for ſuch carnall Ends to admit thoſe that are vnfit, or vvhom God hath not ſent, <hi>The Generall Decree of the Church in the firſt Oecumenicall Councell of Lateran (can. 64.)</hi> vvill shevv; beſides the practiſe of Antiquity, as vvee may reade in an Epiſtle of <hi>S. Auguſtin.</hi> Surely the only vvay of founding Conuents ſecurely, euen in regard of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities,</hi> is by making choice only of thoſe to vvhom God hath giuen fitting diſpoſitions, vvherby vvee may engage his Omnipotence in their preſeruation.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Thoſe therfore vpon vvhoſe <hi>Suffrages</hi> the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi> and <hi>Profeſsion</hi> of <hi>New-comers</hi> doe depend, are to conſider that they are intruſted by the vvhole <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> vvith a matter of ſuch conſequence, as not only the preſent, but future vvellfare or ruine of Conuents is intereſſed in their proceedings: all vvhich truſt they shall betray, if any vndue conſideration of friendship, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, gaine, &amp;c. or a zeale of multiplying Conuents (vvhich is but carnall) shall corrupt their iudgments.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Surely therfore in all reaſon none should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Communities profeſſing the aſpiring to Contemplation, but only ſuch as are diſpoſed therto;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48407:136"/> and that are vvilling, yea deſirous to ſpend their vvhole Liues in Solitude, Praier &amp; Regular Obſeruances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deſignes or thoughts of euer being employed abroad, (yet alvvayes vvith an entire ſubmiſſion to the Ordinances of Superiours.)</p>
                        <p n="12">12. And indeed (as vvas ſaid before concerning Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, that <hi>Actiue Spirits</hi> being to direct the <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> doe endanger the extinguishing of the Spirit of Contemplation: ſo likevviſe) if ſuch be vvithout choice admitted, the ſame miſcheife vvill follovv. Yea I am perſvvaded that many <hi>Actiue Spirits,</hi> though of a Good, ſeemly, outvvard cariage, are no leſſe harmfull to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, then a leſſer number of <hi>looſe Spirits.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe by their good Exteriour shevv they vvill ſeeme vvorthy of Superiority, to vvhich alſo their Activity vvill incline them. And <hi>thoſe are they indeed,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Thaulerus) that are Perſecutours of Contemplation:</hi> for hauing a good opinion of themſelues and their ovvne vvayes (vvhich <hi>looſe Spirits</hi> haue not) they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues euen obliged to depreſſe thoſe other good ſoules that doe not iudge thoſe externall exerciſes and fashions ſuitable to their Profeſſion. And for this reaſon they vvill by faction ſeeke to encreaſe their number: yea and to ſtrengthen their ovvne party, they vvill not ſpare to ioyne vvith <hi>looſe Spirits,</hi> for their ovvne Intereſts yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their diſorders. Neither vvhen they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed their Ends by the ruine of the Spirit of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, vvill Vnquietnes ceaſe: For in a Community vvholly conſiſting of <hi>Actiue Spirits,</hi> factions and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for ſeuerall Ends and deſignes will neuer be wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting.</p>
                        <p n="13">
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:48407:137"/>13. Novv the ſame care that <hi>Superiours</hi> ought to haue about the choice and Admiſſion of vertuous and fitt ſoules into Communities: muſt be continued in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and directing of them being admitted. Great care therfore is to be taken that the misbehauiour of <hi>Nouices</hi> doe not proceed from vvant of knovvledge &amp; Inſtruction in matters of the Spirit: That ſo it may appeare, that if they doe not vvell, it is for vva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of good vvill, and not of Light. Now it is not to be expected that Nouices should be perfect: it vvill ſuffiſe that they ſeriouſly tend to it, by a conſtant purſuance of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Praier and Abſtraction of Life.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Aboue all things therfore Superiours ought to allovv to their ſubiects a competent time dayly for their Recollections, vvhich is the foode of the ſoule: and to deny vvhich vvould be a greater Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, then to refuſe corporall foode to ſlaues after their trauaile. <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues not the name of a Religious man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Caietan:) No not of a Chriſtian</hi> (ſaith <hi>Thaulerus</hi>) that <hi>doth not euery day ſpend ſome reaſonable ſpace in his Interiour. S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> vvould not excuſe euen <hi>Pope Eugenius</hi> himſelfe in the midſt of thoſe continually moſt diſtractiue vveighty affaires of the <hi>Popedome</hi> from this duty. The vvant vvherof is more harmfull to the <hi>Soule,</hi> then that of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall foode is to the <hi>Body:</hi> For he that faſts one day, beſides the preſent paine he finds, vvill the next haue a better and more eager appetite: But a ſoule that through neglect is depriued of her dayly <hi>foode of Praier,</hi> vvill the next day haue a leſſe ſtomack and diſpoſition to it: and ſo in time vvill come vvillingly and euen vvith pleaſure:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48407:137"/> 
                           <hi>to starue in Spirit:</hi> And to ſuch neglect and loathing of <hi>Prayer</hi> she vvill come, if <hi>Superiours</hi> doe hinder, or indeed not encourage her to a conſtant exerciſe of it.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Novv this care of <hi>Superiours</hi> muſt extend it ſelfe as vvell to <hi>Lay-brethren</hi> or <hi>Siſters,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>the Quire:</hi> For they alſo haue the ſame obligation to aſpire to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: And if the appointed <hi>Vocall Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Diuine Office</hi> vvithout the ioyning of dayly Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vvill not auaile to procure in theſe <hi>the Spirit of Recollectednes;</hi> much leſſe vvill thoſe <hi>short Prayers or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> to vvhich the others are obliged.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. To conclude this point: It concernes moſt deeply <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi> to take care that their <hi>ſubiects</hi> liue according to their Profeſſion and obligation: for if it should be by their fault that they faile, it vvill be no excuſe to the ſubiects, but a great part of the burden and punishment vvill light vpon Superiours. And it vvere far better they had neuer come vnder their Direction, but ſtayd in the vvorld, vvhere not hauing the like obligation to the Perfection of Chriſtian vertues, their guilt vvould haue beene the leſſe. Hence <hi>S. Augustin</hi> ſaith; <hi>That as he neuer ſavv better ſoules then thoſe in Religion, ſo likewiſe he neuer ſaw worſe.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe it argues a moſt maliciouſly ill habit of ſoule, vvhen in the midſt of ſo great Light, and ſuch helps to Piety, ſpirituall ſloath and Tepidity raignes. And vvhere <hi>Tepidity</hi> is in Religion, although carnall open ſins may be auoided, yet the more dangerous ſins of the Spirit, Pride, Factiouſnes, Enuy &amp;c. doe find occaſions of being raiſed and nourished, perhaps more then in the vvorld. Adde herunto that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48407:138"/> irreuerences and <hi>profaning of the Sacraments</hi> are not ſo common in the vvorld, vvhere the obligations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of participating are not ſo frequent. And laſtly, vvhich is moſt conſiderable, thoſe vvho in Religion are ſluggish and indeuout, doe grovv continually vvorſe &amp; vvorſe, being more and more hardned by the daily heartleſſe Exerciſe of <hi>Praier</hi> and <hi>Tepide Communions:</hi> For vvhere the <hi>Sacaments</hi> doe not produce the good effects for vvhich God gaue them, they doe occaſionally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe hardnes of heart and impenitency: Hence ſaith <hi>Thaulerus, It were better to take into ones body a million of Deuills, then once to take the Body of our Lord, being in an vnfitt diſpoſition.</hi> And ſo it is a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and almoſt miraculous thing if God giue the Grace of a <hi>new conuerſion</hi> to Soules that in Religion are become habitually <hi>Tepide</hi> and ſtained vvith knovvne impurity, for they being inſenſible of their ſoules good in the midſt of all aduantages poſſible to be had, cannot by any change to a better ſtate be amended: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (it is to be feared) ſuch doe generally dye in the ſtate vvherin they liued. Wheras <hi>in the world an ill liuer</hi> may farre more probably meete with helpes of <hi>Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> by <hi>change of ſtate, place</hi> &amp;c. or by ſicknes: vvheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>S. Bernard profeſſed, That he would not doubt to giue a preſent Abſolution to the moſt enormous ſinner liuing in the world, if he would promiſe to enter into a Religious life: But</hi> vvhat hopes can be of him that after he has left the vvorld, ſo habitually neglects God? <hi>What</hi> change, <hi>what</hi> nevv occaſions can be afforded to him for his Conuerſion?</p>

                        <p n="1">1. THERE vvil be occaſion in the follovving <hi>Treatiſes</hi> to ſpeake of ſeuerall <hi>ſpeciall Duties</hi> of Religious Perſons, as <hi>How</hi> they are to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in <hi>Exteriour Offices,</hi> in <hi>Sicknes, Refections</hi> &amp;c. I vvill therfore content my ſelfe to adioine here a few Directions and Cautions addreſſed particularly to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners or <hi>Nouices</hi> in Religion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Daily experience confirmes that vvhich Spirituall Writers obſerue, that God in great Goodnes to ſoules, does vſually vpon their <hi>firſt Conuerſion</hi> beſtovv vpon them a great <hi>Feruour</hi> in Diuine &amp; Religious Duties, vvhich therfore <hi>our Holy Father</hi> calls <hi>Feruorem Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi> Yea euen naturally the inbred liking that our infirme Nature has to all <hi>Nouelty</hi> and change, cauſes a more then ordinary pleaſure, diligence &amp; earneſtnes in any New-begun Employment.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To this purpoſe there is in the <hi>Annalls of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans</hi>
                           <pb n="226" facs="tcp:48407:139"/> related a paſſage touching a deuout <hi>Brother</hi> called <hi>Michael Magothi,</hi> by vvhich vvee may learne the ground and intention of Allmighty God in beſtovving ſuch a Feruour. The <hi>Story</hi> is this. There vvas one of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Brethren in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent that obſerued of himſelfe, that ordinarily vvhen he vvas in any Externall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Study, Labour &amp;c, <hi>God</hi> did <hi>preuent his Soule with his bleſsings of Sweetnes,</hi> and an affection often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Senſible Deuotion:</hi> the vvhich vvhenſoeuer he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe purpoſely to <hi>Prayer,</hi> forſooke him. Wherupon he addreſſed himſelfe to this good <hi>Brother Michael</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Counſell. Who anſvvered him thus, When you are vvalking at leaſure in the Market-place, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of nothing, there meetes you a man vvith a veſſell of vvine to ſell: He inuites you to buy it, much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the excellency of it. And the better to perſvvade you, he offers you <hi>gratis</hi> a ſmall glaſſe of it, to the end that being delighted vvith the colour and fragrancy of it, you may be more tempted to buy the vvhole veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, vvhich, you muſt expect, vvill coſt you very deare. Euen ſo <hi>our Lord Ieſus</hi> vvhilſt your thoughts are vvandring vpon other matters, either in reading, or hearing a Sermon, or vvorking, by <hi>a ſecret Inſpiration</hi> inuites you povverfully (inſtilling a fevv drops of his ſvveetnes into your heart) <hi>to tast how delicious he is.</hi> But this is but tranſitory, being offred not to ſatiate or inebriate you, but only to allure you to his ſeruice. And therfore if you expect any more, you muſt conſider, it is to be ſold, and a deare price paid for it. For Spirituall Svveetnes can be obtained no other vvay but by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48407:139"/> corporall affliction, nor Reſt but by labour.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Good Soules therfore are often to be exhorted to make good vſe of this <hi>Feruour,</hi> and to improue it dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (yet vvith Diſcretion) therby to produce in their hearts an vnshaken <hi>Reſolution</hi> to proceede in the vvaies of the Diuine loue, notvvithſtanding any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or paine that may happen. They muſt not expect that this <hi>Feruour</hi> vvill be laſting: for being ſeated in the inferiour, groſſer part of the Soule, it is not of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, ſince it may eaſily be altered, euen by any change made in the Bodily humours, or by Externall occurrents. So that if it be not vvell managed, and good vſe made of it to fixe holy and reſolute Deſires in the Spirit (vvhich are more laſting, as not depending on the Body or outvvard things) it is iuſtly to be feared, that God will not beſtovv the like aftervvard.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>A Nouice-ship</hi> is a golden time for the learning and practiſing matters of the Spirit. In that short ſpace therfore a Religious Perſon is <hi>to raiſe a stock</hi> for his vvhole future life: So that if <hi>a Nouice-ship</hi> be negligently &amp; vnprouidently ſpent, he vvill ſcarce euer haue the like opportunity to promote his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Good. For after his <hi>Profeſsion</hi> he vvill, beſides Liberty, haue many more diſtractions, more freedome of Conuerſation, and more entercourſe vvith the Nevves &amp; affaires abroad. Beſides he vvill not vtterly be out of danger of ſome <hi>Offices</hi> &amp; employments, for the diſcharge of vvhich ſome perhaps vvill ſuppoſe him already fit &amp; prepared in Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>At the going out of the Nouice-ship,</hi> the perſon is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48407:140"/> to be very carefull vvith vvhom he conuerſes, ſo as to become an invvard acquaintance: leaſt being ſo tender as he is yet, he happen quickly to be corrupted vvith the Society of negligent, <hi>Tepide Companions.</hi> For want of this care too oft it happens, that all the good gotten in a Nouice-ship is cleane loſt in a short time: ſince vſually things are no other vvay preſerued but by the ſame meanes that they vvere firſt gotten. Therfore ſince it vvas by Praier &amp; Abſtraction of Life that a Nouice procured all the litle proportion of Diuine Loue that he is poſſeſſed of, he muſt expect that it will no other vvay be preſerued. For this Reaſon, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite that the <hi>Superiour</hi> should appoint ſuch an one his <hi>Companions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. A Soule muſt conſider that it is not a litle dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor yet the ſpace of a yeare or tvvo, that vvill, ordinarily ſpeaking, ſuffiſe to get an Habit and Stability in Mortification and Prayer. And therfore <hi>a young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner</hi> ought to imprint deeply in his heart this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Aduice, That his Duty is</hi> neuer to abate or ſlacken, but rather continually to encreaſe in firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde and Reſolution to proceede coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly during the vvhole courſe of his follovving Life in the Internall Exerciſes of Spirit. For he is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that his Nouice-ship being once ended, he muſt neuer expect ſuch aduantages therto aftervvard, ſuch Stillnes, ſuch vvant of interruptions and Tentations, ſuch cleare Light and ſuch calmnes of Paſſions, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed before. Therfore leaſt by a change of his State from a rigorous ſolitude and ſilence to ordinary conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48407:140"/> and perhaps Employments, or (hovveuer) ſtudies, he should come to endanger a decay in Spirit, and ſo be miſerably reduced to his firſt naturall State, or vvorſe: (for indeed, vvorſe it vvill be, if ſuch a decay happen:) let him be very vigilant and induſtrious to auoid all things that may hinder him from proſecuting Internall Prayer, and let him be carefull to continue according to the vtmoſt of his ability to vſe all Abſtraction poſſible, as if he vvere ſtill in his <hi>Nouice-ship.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Indeed <hi>Superiours</hi> ought to be very carefull not to put their <hi>young Religious</hi> into Diſtractiue Employments or ſtudies, either ſooner, or more then can vvell ſtand vvith their ſpirit, or before they be reaſonably vvell grounded in Prayer. For hovv is it poſſible for <hi>an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Beginner,</hi> hauing ſuch hindrances, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in Spirit? Wheras if a good <hi>foundation</hi> of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Prayer vvere once laid, ſuch a ſoule by being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to his ſtudies or Externall Offices, vvill ſuffer no decay; yea moreouer he vvill probably proffit in Studies aboue the proportion of his naturall abilities: by reaſon that <hi>Paſsions,</hi> vvhich much diſtract and darken euen the naturall Vnderſtanding, vvill be much abated by Prayer: And moreouer he vvill vndertake his ſtudies as a Duty and matter of Conſcience, vvhich vvill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his attention and diligence. Yet perhaps by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Abſtinence and Exerciſes in Spirit, his bodily ſtrength vvill not be vigorous enough to enable him to ſupport very much ſtudy: And if it should proue ſo, the loſſe is not great, ſince the Diuine Loue vvill ſufficiently recompence all other vvants. So it fared vvith <hi>our holy
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48407:141"/> Father</hi> vvho, as <hi>S. Gregory</hi> ſaies, vvas <hi>ſapienter indoctus,</hi> his vviſedome conſiſted in deſpiſing all learning vvhich vvas not helpfull or not neceſſary to his aduancement in the Diuine Loue, vvhich alone is the true Wiſedome and learning.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Truly ſo great harme comes to <hi>young Religious</hi> after a Nouice-ship vvell ſpent, by being put immediatly to Schooles, &amp; for that purpoſe diſpenſed vvith, in a great meaſure, about their <hi>Monasticall Duties</hi> of Prayer, Abſtraction, Silence &amp;c: That it vvere very good and fit, vvhen Perſons of tender Age come to demand the Habit, to put them of: and in the firſt place to informe them vvell about Prayer: and to endeauour to perſvvade them, that before they vndertake a Religious State, they should diſpatch their courſe of Philoſophy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, and during ſuch a courſe to vſe as much Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Recollection as vvell they can, for vvhich they vvill then find more time then if they had bene Religious, becauſe they shall not be interrupted by the Quire &amp; other Regular Obſeruances: So that if <hi>Studies</hi> be then a hindrance to Prayer, hovv much more vvould they be ſo, in caſe they had bene Religious? Hauing done all this, then in Gods name let them demand the <hi>Habit.</hi> By this meanes good Soules vvould not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their Religious Courſe, nor put in danger ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againe to recouer the Spirit of Prayer. And if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving ſuch Directions they should come to dye before the time of taking the Habit, they may aſſure themſelues that in Gods account they shall be eſteemed as Religious Soules, vvholly conſecrated vnto him.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. IT will not be amiſſe to adioyne to this <hi>Section</hi> concerning a Religious State, certaine Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations &amp; Aduices touching <hi>a ſubiect,</hi> vvhich though it pertaine not to Religious perſons in generall, yet is <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to our Profeſsion in the English Congregation of S.

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>An Employment</hi> this is of high importance, and moſt <hi>ſublime Perfection</hi> if duly vndertaken and adminiſtred. But the care therof only belongs to <hi>Superiours:</hi> And indeed it is vvorthy both of their Prudence and zeale: by a right managing vvherof they may procure great Glory to God, and good to Soules miſerably miſlead by infinite &amp; moſt pernicious Errours.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But as for <hi>particular Religious,</hi> they are merely to be <hi>paſsiue</hi> in the buſines: they are to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the vndergoing of all the paines, incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and dangers of it, <hi>whenſoeuer</hi> it shall be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48407:142"/> on them. But this being only <hi>an acceſsary obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Capacity,</hi> they are not to ſuppoſe that vvhen God giues them a Vocation to a Religious Life, that this doth make any alteration at all in their <hi>Eſſentiall Deſigne,</hi> moſt ſecure and profitable to their ovvne Soules, vvhich is the leading a Solitary, Deuout and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Life, and therin aſpiring to Contemplation: This only muſt they aime at, and to this muſt they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their thoughts and Actions, as if they vvere all their liues long to be <hi>impriſoned</hi> in their <hi>Cloysters.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither entring, nor aftervvards muſt they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any Thoughts or deſignes about any thing that is out of the limits of their Conuents, in vvhich, for as much as concernes themſelues, their deſire and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be to liue and dye. Particularly they ought to banish out of their minds all meditations and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to goe in Miſſion into England. Yea if they vvill indeed comply vvith their Eſſentiall Profeſſion, they muſt reſolue, as much as lyes in them,, and vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to God or diſobedience to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to preuent ſuch an Employment (of vvhich they cannot vvithout Pride thinke themſelues wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, or able to encounter all the Tentations and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers accompanying it) ſimply and ſincerely confining all their Thoughts and affections to that Life of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Abſtraction and Prayer vvhich they haue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in vvhich their Soules vvill find trueſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Security.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſequently</hi> neither muſt they (vvith an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to approue vnto their Superiours their fitnes

In caſe their <hi>Superiours</hi> (vvho are only concerned in that buſines) shall require of them to apply themſelues diligently to ſuch <hi>Studies</hi> as may fit them for <hi>the Miſsion,</hi> they are obliged therin to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to Obedience. Yet euen in that caſe, if they find that much time cannot be ſpent in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt to their Spirit, and a neglect or preiudice to their appointed Recollections, they ought to acquaint their Superiours vvith their Caſe, vvho no doubt will preferre the good and aduancement of their Soules by Solitude, Purity of Spirit and Internall Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other Conſiderations whatſoeuer. Yea they vvill iudge <hi>Prayer</hi> to be <hi>a better diſpoſition,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a greater enablement, euen for ſuch <hi>a Calling,</hi> then <hi>Study:</hi> And vvill take heed hovv they ſend any abroad that for their Studies neglect their Prayer.

                        <p n="5">5. It cannot eaſily be imagined, hovv miſcheiuous to many Soules the neglect of ſuch Aduices may be. <hi>Some</hi> vvill perhaps haue a mind to take the Habit for that End &amp; intent principally of going aftervvard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

For all their thoughts almoſt, all their Affections, hopes and Deſignes vvill be caryed abroad into another Countrey: ſo that the place of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion</hi> vvill be eſteemed a place of <hi>Exile</hi> to them. And ſo far vvill they be from procuring a Diuine Light and Grace to enable them for ſo terrible an Employment by the meanes of Prayer, that Prayer and Solitude vvill be diſtaſtfull to them.

                        <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING ſo largely treated of <hi>the nature &amp; end of a Contemplatiue Life</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as likewiſe of the <hi>only Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> from whom it is to be learned; &amp;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48407:148"/> the <hi>Schoole of Solitude</hi> in vvhich he giues his directions; Order requires that vvee novv treate of the ſpeciall Inſtructions touching the <hi>meanes</hi> or inſtruments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the obtaining of the ſupernaturall end aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to by vs. Concerning vvhich our diſcourſe vvill not need to be ſo diffuſed, conſidering the large ſcope that vvee haue allovved to ourſelues in the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Treatiſe, in vvhich mention alſo vvas made of much of that vvhich is to follovv.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Seuerall <hi>Myſticall Authours,</hi> each one abounding in his ovvne ſence, and raiſing <hi>a Frame of Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> as ſuited beſt to his ovvne Imagination and deſigne, haue made ſeuerall Partitions of the Duties of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Life: And it is not a matter much conſiderable vvhich of them should be preferred. But to the end the beſt eaſe and Helpe may be afforded to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Readers Memory, the <hi>Diuiſion</hi> of them shall be the <hi>Shortest</hi> that may be,, yet ſufficiently and clearly enough comprehending all neceſſary Duties, namely vnder theſe tvvo Heads of 1. <hi>Mortification.</hi> 2. <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Now to the end that the grounds of the fitnes of this Diuiſion may be better vnderſtood: vvee are to remember, that the glorious End of a Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Life (to vvit, Vnion in Spirit vvith God by Loue) is entirely ſupernaturall and Diuine, ſo that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Man by any naturall ability and ſtrength, although he vvere free from ſins, to attaine vnto it: And much more is this impoſſible to him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, ſince he is naturally moſt auerſe from it, being vvholly poſſeſſed and filled vvith nothing but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48407:148"/> Selfe-Loue, Propriety and Pride, abſolutly inconſiſtent vvith ſuch an Vnion. Therfore the foundation of all our ſpirituall Duties muſt be <hi>a true knowledge,</hi> 1. <hi>Of ourſelues,</hi> our ovvne <hi>Nothing,</hi> our vnproffitablenes, vilenes and miſery, vvhich is to be the Obiect of our Auerſion and Hatred: And 2. <hi>Of the allſufficiency,</hi> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Being, infinite Perfections, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Beauty and Goodnes <hi>of God,</hi> vvho is to be the only Obiect of our Contemplation and Loue: And conſequently vpon this Knovvledge all our endeauours towards this End (being directed by a Diuine Light and aſſiſted by Diuine Grace) muſt be employed, <hi>firſt in remouing thoſe impediments,</hi> and <hi>next</hi> conſequently <hi>in approching directly to God,</hi> an immediate vnion with vvhom is aſpired to, as the only End of our creation, &amp; perfection of our Intellectiue Nature. Wee muſt renounce &amp; fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ourſelues, that vvee may dravv neare vnto God: Wee muſt deſtroy <hi>Selfe-loue</hi> in our ſoules, that ſo the <hi>Diuine Loue</hi> may be raiſed &amp; increaſed in them. Now it is by <hi>Mortification</hi> that ſelfe loue &amp; all other our naturall deordinations, vvhich hinder a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vnion, are remoued; And it is by <hi>Prayer</hi> that vvee directly tend to a Diuine vnion. By <hi>the former</hi> vvee exerciſe all duties &amp; practiſe all vertues vvhich regard ourſelues: (for vertues, are ſo far only to be eſteemed vvorthy of that name, in as much, &amp; as far as they are mortificatory to our inordinate paſſions and affections, as Humility of Pride, Patience of Anger, Temperance of ſenſuall deſires &amp;c.) And <hi>Prayer</hi> (in the notion in vvhich it is here vnderſtood) includes all our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48407:149"/> duties directly pertaining to God, as comprehending all manner of internall Actuations &amp; operations of the ſoule tovvards God, by the vnderſtanding contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; admiring him: by the vvill &amp; Affections, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, obeying, louing &amp; adhering to him; &amp; in a vvord the vvhole ſoule reſigning &amp; ſubmitting it ſelfe &amp; the body alſo, vvith all things belonging to eath of them, to be diſpoſed according to his diuine vvill, both for time &amp; eternity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This <hi>Diuiſion</hi> deſerues the rather to be approued, becauſe <hi>Heſychius</hi> an Ancient, Illuminated <hi>Monke</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe de Puritate Cordis,</hi> hath conformably redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all ſpirituall duties to. 1. <hi>Temperance.</hi> 2. And <hi>Prayer.</hi> By <hi>temperance</hi> vnderſtanding the very ſame that is here meant by <hi>Mortification;</hi> for as he expreſſes his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; This <hi>temperance is a</hi> generall abſtaining from all things that vvould any vvay diſorder the affections, or obſcure the light of the ſoule; He calls it likevviſe <hi>(Cuſtodiam Cordis;) A guard or watch ſet ouer the heart,</hi> forcing it to repell all vaine &amp; vnproffitable thoughts, the vvhich if they be too freely admitted, doe hinder from obſeruing the ſnares &amp; ſuggeſtions of the deuill or of our Corrupt nature, &amp; doe vvithall diſturbe the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In theſe tvvo Duties therefore of <hi>Mortification</hi> &amp; <hi>Prayer</hi> all good is comprehended: For by the exerciſe of <hi>Mortification</hi> thoſe tvvo generall moſt deadly enemies of our ſoules, <hi>ſelfe loue</hi> &amp; <hi>Pride</hi> are combatted &amp; ſubdued; to vvit, by the meanes of thoſe tvvo <hi>fandamentall</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>vertues</hi> of <hi>Diuine Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Humility.</hi> And <hi>Prayer</hi>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:48407:149"/> exerciſed in vertue of theſe tvvo vvill of both <hi>by way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration</hi> obtaine, &amp; alſo vvith <hi>a direct Efficiency</hi> ingraft a nevv <hi>Diuine Principle</hi> &amp; nature in vs, vvhich is the <hi>Diuine Spirit,</hi> the vvhich vvill become <hi>a new life</hi> vnto vs, &amp; the very ſoule of our ſoules, by degrees raiſing vs higher &amp; higher out of our corrupt nature, till at laſt vvee be made <hi>one with God,</hi> by an vnion as perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant &amp; immediate, as in this fraile life an intellectiue ſoule is capable of.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And both theſe duties of <hi>mortification</hi> &amp; <hi>Prayer</hi> are ſo abſolutely <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that they muſt neither of them euer ceaſe, but continually encreaſe in perfection &amp; vertue to the end of our liues. For though <hi>ſelfe-loue &amp; pride</hi> may by mortification be ſubdued; yet as long as vvee are impriſoned in mortall bodies of flesh &amp; blood, they vvill neuer be totally rooted out of vs, but that euen the moſt perfect ſoules vvill find in themſelues matter enough for further mortification. And againe <hi>our vnion with God by</hi> Prayer can neuer either be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, but that it vvill be interrupted, ſo as that the ſoule vvill fall from her height back ſome degrees into nature againe; <hi>nor</hi> is there any degree of it ſo perfect, pure &amp; ſpirituall, but that it may, &amp; by exerciſe vvill become yet more &amp; more pure vvithout all limits.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The diligent Exerciſe of each of theſe doth much aduance the practiſe of the other. For as <hi>Mortification</hi> is a good diſpoſition to <hi>prayer,</hi> yea ſo neceſſary that a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall immortified ſoule cannot raiſe herſelfe vp ſo much as to looke to God vvith any cordiall deſire to pleaſe him, or to loue &amp; be reſigned to him, &amp; much leſſe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48407:150"/> vnited to him, ſo likevviſe by <hi>Prayer</hi> the ſoule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines light to diſcouer vvhatſoeuer inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in her are to be mortified, &amp; alſo ſtrength of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace actually &amp; effectually to ſubdue them.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Hence it may eaſily appeare that of theſe tvvo, <hi>Prayer</hi> is much the more <hi>valuable</hi> &amp; noble Exerciſe 1. <hi>Becauſe</hi> in prayer of Contemplation conſiſts the <hi>eſsentiall happines</hi> both of this life, &amp; that vvhich is to come: So that <hi>Mortification</hi> regards <hi>Prayer</hi> as the meanes diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to an end; for therfore a deuout ſoule is obliged to mortify her inordinate Affections, to the end she may therby be diſpoſed to an vnion vvith God. 2. <hi>Becauſe Mortifications</hi> are neuer duly &amp; proffitably vndergone but only in vertue of prayer. Whereas poſſible it may be, that <hi>Prayer</hi> alone may be conſiderably aduanced vvithout any other notable mortifications, in caſe that God haue prouided none for the ſoule. 3. <hi>Becauſe Prayer</hi> is vvithall in it ſelfe the moſt excellent &amp; effectuall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; for in &amp; by it the moſt ſecret riſings of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate paſſions are contradicted; yea the mind &amp; ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour vvill are vvholly abſtracted &amp; eleuated aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that for the time all paſſions are quieted, &amp; all creatures (eſpecially our ſelues) tranſcended, forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp; in a ſort annihilated.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Notvvithſtanding in caſe that God, as he ſeldome failes, doe prouide for vs occaſions of mortification out of Prayer: If vvee be negligent in making good vſe of them to the promoting of our ſelues in ſpirit, vvee shall decreaſe both in grace &amp; Prayer. As on the contrary by a good vſe of them, vvee shall both certainly &amp; ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48407:150"/> be aduanced in the vvaies of the ſpirit. So that <hi>neither of them alone is to be relied</hi> on. <hi>Mortification without Prayer</hi> vvill be but ſuperficiall, or (it is to be feared) hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall; And <hi>Prayer with a neglect of mortification,</hi> will be heartles, diſtracted &amp; of ſmall vertue.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The ſubiect therfore of this &amp; the follovving Treatiſe being a recommendation of <hi>theſe two</hi> moſt neceſſary &amp; moſt excellent <hi>Instruments of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> reaſon requires that of the two, <hi>Mortification</hi> should in the <hi>first place</hi> be treated of, in as much as it is not only the leſſe perfect: but becauſe alſo the proper vſe of it is to diſpoſe and make euen and plaine the vvay to the other, by leauelling the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Pride, raiſing the valleys of ſloth, and ſmoothing the roughnes and inequalities of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but eſpecially by remouing out of the vvay that <hi>generall impediment,</hi> vvhich is <hi>Propriety of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall carnall wills.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. NOvv intending to treate of <hi>Mortification,</hi> firſt <hi>in generall;</hi> &amp; aftervvard of the <hi>ſpeciall kinds</hi> of it, at leaſt ſuch as more peculiar to Internall liuers: my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is not to diſcourſe in particular of ſuch deordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are generally acknovvledged to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <hi>ſinfull</hi> either mortally, or (in a groſſer manner) venially, that is, ſuch as that the actions or omiſſions to vvhich they adhere, can in no circumſtances be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or permitted, although the end or intention (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) of them vvere neuer ſo good: Such as are <hi>officious lies, ſmaller reuenges,</hi> or <hi>calumniations</hi> &amp;c. For it is ſuppoſed that the ſoules for vvhoſe benefit theſe <hi>Instructions</hi> vvere intended, are not in a ſtate to ſtand in need of aduices concerning ſuch matters: But are
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48407:151"/> ſuppoſed to be entred into a vvay of <hi>Perfection;</hi> being deſirous, yea through Gods grace reſolued to abandon all things, &amp; to caſt avvay all adheſions &amp; affections vvhatſoeuer that are inordinate, not only ſuch as vvill endanger to kill the ſoule, but alſo ſuch as vvould make it ſickly &amp; infirme, or ſtaine the Luſter &amp; brightnes of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>obiects</hi> therfore of <hi>Mortification</hi> vvhich I shall cheifly handle, are ſuch <hi>defects</hi> as though indeed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they be ſinfull, yet are not acknovvledged by all to be ſo, but are called only <hi>imperfections;</hi> being ſuch ſins as conſidering the frailty of our nature, can hardly be auoyded, &amp; neuer totally rooted out, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant about obiects vvhich vvee may lavvfully &amp; muſt neceſſarily vſe, but the fault is that vvee doe vvith ſome deordination either adhere to, or are auerted from ſuch obiects. In a vvord, ſuch ſins they are that except vvhen they are more groſſe, it vvould be an endleſſe &amp; vnproffitable labour to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matters of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, although the correcting &amp; abating of them ought to be the obiect of our dayly care.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I vvill endeauour to explaine my meaning more fully in this matter; becauſe it is the ground of the vvhole follovving diſcourſe. Wee muſt knovv then that <hi>the duty of a Chriſtian, (much more of a ſoule that aſpires to Perfection) is to loue nothing at all but God, or in order to him;</hi> that is, as a meane &amp; inſtrument to beget &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Diuine loue in our ſoules. All adheſion to creatures by affection, vvhether ſuch affection be great or ſmall, is accordingly ſinfull, more or leſſe: ſo that if
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48407:152"/> being depriued of any thing or perſons vvhatſoeuer, or being pained by any thing, vvee find a trouble &amp; ſorrovv in our minds for the loſſe or ſuffring of the thing <hi>it ſelfe;</hi> ſuch trouble in vvhat degree ſoeuer argues that our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vvas ſinfull; not only becauſe the affection vvas exceſſiue, but becauſe it vvas an affection, the obiect vvherof vvas not God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But yet <hi>withall</hi> this affection vvhich I ſay is vnlavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is not ſimply ſuch an one as reſides &amp; is confined to <hi>ſenſitiue nature,</hi> for that is impoſſible to be rooted out, neither is there any fault at all in it, conſidered as ſuch. For to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, yea euen to <hi>our Lord himſelfe</hi> many obiects vvere pleaſing &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſenſe; his fight &amp; taſt tooke contentment in pleaſurable obiects; &amp; there vvas in nature an auerſion from paine, &amp; an earneſt deſire to prolong naturall life; &amp; in all this there vvas not the leaſt <hi>imperfection.</hi> The Affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to creatures therfore vvhich wee affirme to be ſinfull, are ſuch as are ſeated in the ſuperiour ſoule, or <hi>rationall will,</hi> by vvhich the mind &amp; vvill conſiders &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres vnto creatures; &amp; knovvingly &amp; vvillingly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the attaining &amp; enioying of them, as if they vvere the good, not of ſenſe only (for ſo they are) but of the perſon, the vvhich indeed they are not; for <hi>the only good of an Intellectuall nature is God;</hi> vvho is only exalted aboue it, vvhereas all other creatures are but equall or inferiour to it. To the ſuperiour vvill therfore all things but God muſt be <hi>indifferent,</hi> as in &amp; for themſelues, &amp; only to be loued as they are ſeruiceable to the ſpirit. So that if things vvhich are vnpleaſant, yea deſtructiue to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48407:152"/> inferiour nature doe yet aduance the ſpirit in her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to God; or if by the vvill &amp; prouidence of God they are preſented to her to ſuffer, she muſt vvith all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference &amp; reſignation accept of them, though ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue nature doe neuer ſo much ſtruggle &amp; contradict.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A moſt perfect <hi>Example</hi> herof is giuen by <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,</hi> the vvhich vvee are obliged to the vtmoſt of our capacity &amp; enablement to imitate. Though <hi>ſenſitiue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in him tooke contentment in life &amp; in the Actions &amp; functions therof, &amp; aboue all things did abhorre a diſſolution by death, eſpecially ſuch a death accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vvith ſuch inexpreſſible torments &amp; shame: And though for our inſtruction he voluntarily <hi>gaue way to Inferiour nature</hi> to expreſſe ſuch her innocent inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; auerſion; yet vvhen the vvill of <hi>his Father</hi> oppoſed it ſelfe &amp; prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him a cup in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree mortall to nature, &amp; all the inclinations therof, he moſt vvillingly, quietly &amp; chearfully accepted it, then ſubduing all reluctances in nature: The vvhich reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in him vvere to the thing it ſelfe conſidered in it ſelfe, &amp; not at all to the dictates of the Superiour ſoule, the vvhich had ſo abſolute a dominion ouer ſenſitiue nature, that it neuer oppoſed it ſelfe, or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the leaſt vnvvillingnes to conforme it ſelfe to the dictates of reaſon, though vvith its ovvne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Wheras therfore there are continually preſented to our outvvard &amp; invvard ſenſes infinite obiects plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; diſpleaſing to them: And that the functions of of life, vvhich vvee are bound to preſerue, cannot be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48407:153"/> exerciſed vvithout admitting the vſe of many things delightfull to ſenſitiue nature, <hi>meates, drinkes, Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue conuerſatious,</hi> &amp; <hi>relaxations of mind</hi> &amp;c: vvee are to conſider &amp; reſolue, that none of theſe things pleaſing to the appetite are giuen to be poſſeſſed vvith any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all, or fruition, but the mere ſimple vſe of them is allovved vs for the good of the ſoule; &amp; the contentment that the appetite naturally takes in them, is no further, nor vvith other intention to be admitted, then in as much as therby the ſpirit, or rationall vvill is, or may be enabled more chearfully to purſue its ſupreme Good. And vvith this end &amp; intention, to admit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vvith caution &amp; diſcretion of moderate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts &amp; contentments to Inferiour nature, is not in it ſelfe at all vnlavvfull; on the contrary it is fitting, requiſite &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="7">7.

                        <p n="2">2. Yea they vvho naturally haue much <hi>interiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſednes &amp; stillnes of paſsions,</hi> &amp; ſeeme not much to be troubled vvith rebellion in ſenſuality, &amp; that moreouer haue in them a kind of <hi>naturall deuotion</hi> yet euen theſe, vvhatſoeuer they appeare outvvardly in shevv, are full of ſelfe loue, vvhich is the principle of all their Actions. If they loue Quietnes, it is becauſe nature takes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in it; And their ſelfe-loue is more abſtruſe &amp; more deeply ſeated in the roote of the ſpirit it ſelfe; And therfore oftimes it is hard to be cured, becauſe not ſo eaſily diſcouered. Neither indeed is there any hope of remedy till by prayer they get a light to diſcouer the ſaid ſecret ſelfe loue; and grace by mortification to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is true, ſuch <hi>good Naturall diſpoſitions</hi> may be <hi>beneficiall</hi> to ſoules in <hi>two</hi> reſpects eſpecially. <hi>Firſt in that</hi> by meanes thereof they fall into fevver ſins then more paſſionate Impetuous natures doe; &amp; conſequently doe not put ſo many impediments to grace.

                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:48407:157"/> is, that ſuch diſpoſitions are better fitted for internall Prayer, yea to the perfecteſt kind of it, vvhich is Prayer of <hi>Aſpirations;</hi> ſo that they may with leſſe labour get out of Nature, eleuating the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. An abſolute neceſſity therfore there is for all ſoules to mortify nature, &amp; eſpecially to rectify this generall deprauednes of <hi>Propriety,</hi> by vvhich vvee are to our ſelues our laſt end. The vvhich is done by the Infuſion of Diuine Charity, by vvhich our ſelues are directed to God as our laſt end: And a neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therto is the Mortification of ſelfe loue. And thus far all Chriſtians are obliged to mortify themſelues, namely to cure the mortally ſinfull diſorders of their ſoules. A <hi>neceſsity</hi> likevviſe there is <hi>(vpon ſuppoſition of aſpiring to Perfection)</hi> to mortify all <hi>deliberate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> to any the leaſt <hi>veniall defects</hi> and deordinations of our ſoules. <hi>The which Duty</hi> of Mortification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of vs, that deliberately and cuſtomarily vvee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admit into our minds <hi>(internally)</hi> vaine thoughts; nor <hi>(outwardly)</hi> ſpeake or exerciſe Acts of vaine loue, vaine hope, vaine feare, or vaine ſorrovv: &amp; <hi>all is vaine that is not referred to God,</hi> or is not done for him.</p>

                           </hi> tends to ſubiect the body to the ſpirit, and the Spirit to God. And this it does by croſſing the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſence which are quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to thoſe of the <hi>diuine ſpirit,</hi> vvhich ought to be our cheife &amp; <hi>only Principle.</hi> For by ſuch croſſing &amp; afflicting of the body, Selfe-loue &amp; Selfevvill (the poyſon of our ſpirits) are abated, &amp; in time in a ſort deſtroyed; &amp; inſtead of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there entreth into the ſoule the <hi>diuine loue</hi> &amp; <hi>diuine will,</hi> &amp; take poſſeſſion therof: And therin conſiſts our Perfection &amp; happines,</p>

                        <p n="7">7. Indeed the only poſſible vvay for a ſoule to make <hi>Proſperity</hi> an occaſion of improuement to her, is by a voluntary croſſing &amp; diminishing of it, that is, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduantage euen from thence to mortify nature; As for example, <hi>in caſe of Riches</hi> &amp; honours, <hi>by carying</hi> our ſelues both exteriourly &amp; interiourly to God &amp; man vvith more humility &amp; modeſty, as if vvee were not at all in ſuch plenty &amp; eminency: alſo <hi>by ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> vaine ioy &amp; complacency in ſuch things; <hi>by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging</hi> that vvee are not <hi>Lords</hi> &amp; proprietaires, but only <hi>ſtewards</hi> &amp; diſpenſers of ſuch things, from vvhom a ſeuere account shall be required for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents entruſted to vs for others ſakes &amp; not our ovvne. So that it is moſt true, That all the ſecurity, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity &amp; fullnes of our ſoules good conſiſts in a right vſe of thoſe things vvhich are contrary &amp; afflicting to our nature.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In generall, <hi>Mortification</hi> includes the exerciſe of all vertues; for in euery Act of vertue vvee mortify
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48407:158"/> ſome inordinate paſſion &amp; inclination of nature, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that to attaine to perfect Mortification is to be poſſeſſed of all vertues.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The <hi>benefits</hi> &amp; bleſſings that come to our ſoules by exerciſing of <hi>Mortification</hi> are many &amp; moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.

                        <p n="10">10. The <hi>duty of Mortification</hi> being ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, &amp; ſo infinitely beneficiall, &amp; moreouer ſo largely extended, as that it reaches to all manner of naturall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, in ſo much as nothing does an imperfect ſoule any good, further then it is croſſe &amp; mortifying to ſome inordination in her naturall inclinations: <hi>It followes</hi> from hence; that a ſoule that intends to vvalke in theſe vvayes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48407:158"/> of Contemplation had need haue <hi>a great courage;</hi> ſince her deſigne muſt be to combat her ovvne ſelfe in all manner of things to vvhich she naturally beares an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                        <p n="11">11. More particularly, for as much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes thoſe that are <hi>Beginners</hi> in an Internall courſe, they are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in ſuch a ſtate their ſoules are ſo full of impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; defects, that ſcarce in any actions of theirs at all they doe intend God purely, no not euen in thoſe that they performe vvith moſt aduice &amp; preparation, &amp; vvith the greateſt calmenes of ſpirit; Much leſſe in Actions though ſubſtantially good, in vvhich their Paſſions are engaged.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48407:159"/> firſt vpon Superiour &amp; ſpirituall motiues.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. I doe the more earneſtly recommend the practiſe according to this aduice, becauſe I find that ſome <hi>good Spirituall Authours doe counſell a quite contrary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as a remedy &amp; meanes to ſubdue paſsions.</hi> For they vvould haue ſoules vvillingly &amp; purpoſely to raiſe them in ſenſitiue nature, &amp; vvhen they are come to a certaine height, then by the ſtrength of reaſon &amp; motiues of Religion to quiet &amp; pacifie them againe: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, In caſe of an Iniury receiued, they aduiſe that vvee should call to mind all the circumſtances &amp; aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations that are apt to kindle indignation &amp; reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And as ſoone as the Paſſion is inflamed, then to ſuppreſſe it by conſiderations of the example of <hi>our Lord,</hi> &amp; his precept of charity to enemies; Of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Effects of Reuenge, &amp; the bleſſed revvards of Patience &amp;c: The like they ſay concerning a ſenſuall deſire to any obiect, they vvould haue it repreſented vvith all its allurements &amp; charmes, ſo as to moue a ſtrong inclination in ſenſitiue Nature; And this being done, preſently to ſuppreſſe ſuch inclinations by ſtrong Reſolutions &amp; by contrary practiſes. Only they forbid this Practiſe in the paſſion of <hi>ſenſuall Impurity,</hi> the vvhich muſt not be reuiued vpon any pretence vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. <hi>To Perfect ſoules</hi> this Aduice may be <hi>proper,</hi> vvho haue an eſtablished Dominion ouer their paſſions; But as for the <hi>Imperfect,</hi> if they should conforme themſelues to it, <hi>two</hi> great <hi>inconueniences</hi> could ſcarce be preuented. viz. 1. <hi>That</hi> they vvould be in danger either to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvilling
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48407:159"/> or vnable to reſtore Peace vnto their minds once much diſquieted. 2. <hi>By an aduiſed</hi> &amp; earneſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of ſuch obiects as doe raiſe paſſions in their minds, they doe therby fixe more firmely in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the Images of them, &amp; by that meanes doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſaid images to returne at other times againſt their vvills, vvhen perhaps the reaſons &amp; motiues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them vvill either not be ready, or the ſoule in no diſpoſition to make vſe of them; or if she should be vvilling, it is to be doubted that then ſuch motiues vvill not proue efficacious. Therfore Imperfect ſoules may doe beſt to deale vvith all paſſions as they ought vvith thoſe of impurity, namely to get the Maiſtry ouer them, by flying from them, &amp;, if they can, forgetting them.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Yet this aduice of preuenting all paſſions &amp; diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in ſenſitiue nature, may ſometimes ceaſe, vvhen iuſt reaſon &amp; the neceſſary care of the good of others shall require that ſome things be done vvith eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; as it may happen in <hi>the caſe of Superiours</hi> correcting their ſubiects &amp;c: for then it may be conuenient to giue ſome diſcreet vvay to paſſion, vvithout vvhich their reproofes vvould perhaps haue but little effect. Yet euen then alſo care is to be had that they doe not therby preiudice their ovvne Internall <hi>Quiet of mind,</hi> &amp; much leſſe, endanger to diminish true Charity.</p>

                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p n="3">3. The ſame <hi>Practiſe</hi> likevviſe doth after the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt manner ſupply that other <hi>Exerciſe</hi> (oft recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) of a <hi>Continuall thinking on our owne Nothing;</hi> For by conformity to the foreſaid Directions, <hi>Propriety</hi> &amp; <hi>Selfe-will</hi> (by the vvhich alone vvee vvould faine ſeeme to be ſomething more then vvee are or ought to be) are not only in thought, imagination or deſire of mind, but really &amp; effectually abandonned, &amp; the inordinate affections of the ſoule mortified &amp; <hi>annihilated.</hi> And it is only for this end that the ſaid <hi>Exerciſe</hi> is ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48407:161"/> of our ovvne hearts; And the reaſon vvhy this light can be had only by Prayer, is becauſe then alone euery the leaſt defect &amp; moſt ſecret ſuggeſtion hinders our view &amp; contemplation of God, and our tendance to him; &amp; by conſequence is eaſily diſcernable, as being ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene our eyes &amp; <hi>the Sun.</hi> Wheras in our ordinary Vocall Prayers, &amp; externall good Actions, only greater tentations are able perceptibly to diſtract vs.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Thoſe therfore that doe not purſue Internall Prayer can only ſo far mortify their paſſions, that they breake not forth into outvvard expreſſions or Actions. But the <hi>euill Roote</hi> remaines ſtill aliue, cauſing inward diſorders very diſpleaſing to God.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. As for <hi>Croſſes</hi> and aduerſities vvhich a ſoule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes out of the ſtrength of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and not in vertue of Diuine Grace and Prayer: the cheefe effect of them is only to vexe and trouble Nature, or at moſt they ſerue to mortify the ſuperabundant actiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vigour of the internall ſences and naturall Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; by vvhich meanes the perſons may become more Iudicious, Prudent and Temperate; but they peirce not to the Spirit it ſelfe, to cauſe any purity therein, or really to diminish ſelfe-loue. Moreouer the like Croſſes vndergone by vertue of ſuch a <hi>common</hi> Grace, as ordinary good extrouerted Chriſtians doe enioy, though they may be helpfull to preuent the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally poyſonnous effects of ſelfe-loue vvhich is in vs, yet are far from expelling that ſecret ſelfe-loue vvhich lurkes in the inmoſt center of our ſoules; So that they may remaine greiuouſly full of ſtaines and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48407:162"/> and the Diuine loue feeble and eaſy to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, notvvithſtanding the effects of ſuch Croſſes.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Wheras <hi>difficulties</hi> vndergone in vertue of Grace obtained by <hi>Internall Prayer</hi> doe, as it vvere, ſcovvre &amp; purity the ſpirit it ſelfe from the Ruſt of inordinate affections: &amp; ſo doe ſpiritualize all the faculties of the ſoule, cauſing it to become a pure ſpirit, exalted and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from ſenſible obiects &amp; all adheſion to them, from vvhich all vicious impurity proceedes. This is that <hi>Diuiſion of the Soule &amp; Spirit,</hi> mentioned by S. Paul, by vvhich the Pure Spirit vvorkes as a Spirit, not obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor infected vvith ſenſuall Ends and Intereſts.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The vvay of <hi>Mortification</hi> therfore <hi>practiſed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Contemplatiue liuers</hi> is different from that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues,</hi> though liuing in a Religious ſtate, &amp; vvell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced in Actiue exerciſes; for <hi>theſe</hi> endeauour to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their inordinate Affections by combatting them purpoſely &amp; directly, to vvit, by meditating diſcourſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the motiues afforded by Chriſtian doctrine to oppoſe them, as a conſideration of their deformity, danger &amp;c. and alſo by exerciſing an Act of vertue contrary therto, ſo repreſſing the inordinate Paſſion. Wheras <hi>Contemplatiue ſoules</hi> doe indirectly, yet far more efficaciouſly, <hi>mortify their paſsions by tranſcending them,</hi> that is, by eleuating &amp; vniting their ſpirit to God vvith the helpe of pure intellectuall actuations: by this meanes forgetting &amp; drovvning both their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall deſires, yea all created things, &amp; cheifely themſelues in God: So that in <hi>a Tentation</hi> they doe not turne themſelues tovvards the obiect, to the end to reſiſt &amp;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48407:162"/> contradict it; but <hi>by a vigorous Act of Reſignation &amp; loue</hi> they conuert their ſpirits vnto God, ſcorning euen to caſt a regard or glance vpon creatures, that vvould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure their affections from God, &amp; vvhich cannot be conſidered, except in God, vvithout leauing ſome tincture &amp; imperfection in the ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>It is not</hi> therfore the externall practiſe of vertues, nor much leſſe <hi>customary frequent Confeſsions, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Obediences, Auſterities</hi> &amp;c: but pure ſpirituall prayer, &amp; the ſublime degrees of it (to vvit, <hi>Aſpirations, Pure Eleuations of the will</hi> &amp; other ſuch <hi>Diuine Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>) that muſt be <hi>the principall Inſtrument</hi> to bring a ſoule to a ſtate of perfect freedome from exteriour &amp; Interiour Immortification. For by ſuch operations only she is enabled to tranſcend Inferiour nature, &amp; to liue in the quiet, ſecure &amp; Illuminated region of the ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. But <hi>in the meane time</hi> till a deuout ſoule doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to ſuch Perfection of prayer, she muſt be content to vvorke according to her preſent light &amp; enablement, ſo endeauouring to correct her defects by leſſe perfect Exerciſes, &amp; ſuch <hi>as partake of the Actiue way;</hi> And she muſt vvith patience &amp; quietnes of ſpirit beare vvith her ovvne imperfections, as she vvould vvith others, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Gods good time, &amp; endeauouring to haſten the approach of that time by aſſiduous Prayer; by meanes of vvhich alone she may come to expell thoſe defects, vvhich doe novv ſo much exerciſe &amp; trouble her, &amp; alſo to diſcouer &amp; correct many others, vvhich as yet her eyes are too infirme &amp; dimme to ſee.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Indeed the prouident care that God generally
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48407:163"/> hath ouer his children, both <hi>perfect &amp; imperfect,</hi> is vvonderfull, being carefully ſuited to their preſent ſtate. For he does not vſually ſend to <hi>imperfect ſoules</hi> any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications but ſuch as are ordinary &amp; proportionable to their infirmity, namely ſuch as doe gall &amp; afflict their ſenſitiue nature, but doe not peirce into the quick &amp; center of the ſpirit, that remaines free to ſupport the other. But as for <hi>ſoules arriued to the state of Perfection,</hi> or neare it, God doth vſually prouide for them ſtrange, <hi>vnexpreſsible mortifications, most ſubtile Tentations, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations &amp; Deſolations:</hi> the vvhich being vvorthily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, doe vvonderfully purify the ſpirit. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Mortifications <hi>S. Paul</hi> expreſſes thus, <hi>There hath no Tentation taken you, but ſuch as is according to ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humane nature &amp;c:</hi> But the latter thus, <hi>Our wreſtling is not againſt flesh &amp; blood</hi> (the vſuall tentations of Gods imperfect children) <hi>but againſt Principalities &amp; Powers, againſt the Gouernours of the darkenes of this world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſses in high places</hi> (or, things)</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Euery Act of <hi>Mortification</hi> performed by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Internall Prayer doth increaſe in vs the grace of God, &amp; diſpoſe vs to a more perfect future Prayer: As on the contrary, euery act of immortification doth increaſe in vs ſelfe-loue, &amp; doth make vs more indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for future Internall Prayer. Againe <hi>Prayer</hi> enables vs <hi>for future Mortifications,</hi> teaching vs hovv to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take &amp; ſupport them. So that theſe <hi>Duties</hi> muſt neuer be ſeparated; Theſe containe all that an Internall liuer is obliged to.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. I will conclude this Diſcourſe concerning mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48407:163"/> in groſſe vvith one Obſeruation, vvhich may ſerue for a caution to a vvell-minded ſoule that liues an Internall life, to preuent an inconuenience which othervviſe might perhaps ſurpriſe her; It is this; <hi>That it may happen</hi> that Religious or ſpirituall Perſons vvill find a greater difficulty in mortifying &amp; renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome ſenſuall contentments after they haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a ſpirituall courſe, then they formerly found vvhilſt they lead an extrouerted ſecular life in the world. Novv this hapning to them may perhaps ſuggeſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcrupulous, or at leaſt diſquieting thoughts, as if the change that they haue made were not for the better; or as if ſome thing (they vvell knovv not vvhat) vvere amiſſe vvith them. But if they vvill vvell conſider of the matter, they vvill find that this is no ſtrange thing, nor deſeruing that they should much trouble themſelues about it.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. For the <hi>Reaſons</hi> hereof are 1. <hi>Becauſe</hi> if ſuch an one had not purſued an Internall life, he vvould haue perhaps enabled himſelfe to quit one pleaſure by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting himſelfe from thence to ſome other, vvhich vvould haue recompenced &amp; ſatisfied for that loſſe, taking avvay the preſent difficulty: Whereas in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life a ſoule hauing in Reſolution abandoned all ſenſuall pleaſures, as ſuch, that can be abandonned, she cannot recompence the bitternes found in mortifying one, by a deliberate yeilding to another, the pleaſure felt in enioying vvhereof might make her leſſe ſenſible of the loſſe of the other. 2. <hi>Againe</hi> an Imperfect ſoule vvill iudge it neceſſary for the ſuſtaining of corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48407:164"/> &amp; to preuent an vnchearfull diſcontented habit of mind, to allovv vnto her ſelfe ſome contentments recreatiue to ſenſe; And therfore vvhen ſuch are denied her, she vvill be apt to be impatient, or if she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to contradict &amp; reſiſt ſuch impatience of nature, she vvill doe it more feebly &amp; faintly. 3. <hi>Becauſe</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a ſoule can liue &amp; not take pleaſure in ſomething or other, that aſſords contentment either to the ſenſe or the ſpirit. Novv a ſpirituall perſon being yet in an imperfect ſtate, has but little preſent ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the exerciſes proper to his vvay, except God novv &amp; then viſit him vvith ſenſible deuotion: for the cheife pleaſure that ſpirituality affords is in hope only, &amp; that vvithout any regard to the body, it regards the Spirit alone. Novv hope is not ſo attractiue as preſent ſenſuall contentment is. 4. <hi>beſides all</hi> this, ſuch a ſoule not hauing yet chaſed out of the Superiour faculties all affection to ſenſuall pleaſure, &amp; finding for the preſent little or nothing but paine in all her exerciſes both of mortification, &amp; Prayer; No maruell if vvhen pleaſure ſometimes comes in her vvay, that she finds difficulty in reiecting it. Indeed the greateſt Paine comes not from the particular obiects of Mortification, but rather from <hi>tediouſnes</hi> &amp; <hi>irkeſomenes</hi> in being continually in a condition of ſuffring, vvhich she iudges muſt laſt to her liues end. This is very painfull to an imperfect ſoule: But yet by a conſtant practiſe of mortification &amp; Prayer she vvill find daily an abatement of this tediouſnes, &amp; in the end the renouncing of all contentments of ſenſe &amp; nature for themſelues, vvill become eaſy &amp; pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48407:164"/> to her. 5. <hi>

                           <p>§. 6. 7. 8. 9. Extraordinary or ſupernumerary Mortifications are not to be aſſumed without great aduice. They are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome allowed in the Rule of S. Benedict.</p>

                           <p>§. 17. Generally ſpeaking, there is little need that Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Mortifications should be aſsumed.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. HAVING ſpoken <hi>in generall</hi> of <hi>Mortification,</hi> come vvee novv to the <hi>Diuiſion</hi> &amp; kinds of it; And the moſt generall diuiſion of mortification is into thoſe vvhich are. 1. <hi>Neceſsary</hi> 2. <hi>Voluntary.</hi> This is a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion</hi> of vvhich vvee shall haue great vſe through this

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>First</hi> therfore vvithin <hi>the notion of neceſsary Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications</hi> are comprehended 1. <hi>Not only</hi> ſuch croſſes &amp; afflictions to nature as vvee cannot, though vvee would, auoyd, vvhether they be externall or Internall, as <hi>ſicknes, want, diſgraces, loſse of freinds, tentations, deſolations</hi> &amp;c. (The vvhich indeed are the moſt proper &amp; beneficiall mortifications of all other, as being ſent or ſuffred to come vpon vs by the moſt <hi>Wiſe &amp; Good Prouidence of God</hi> for our good) 2. <hi>but thoſe alſo</hi> that vvee doe or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by vertue of our aſſumed ſtate of life, either by occaſion of any <hi>Law or</hi> humane <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> or by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> &amp; ſubiection to our Superiours, <hi>Conuerſation</hi> vvith our equalls, inferiours &amp;c. 3. <hi>Thoſe alſo</hi> that wee vndertake by the direction of our <hi>Confeſsarius</hi> or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Guide, (to vvhom notvvithſtanding our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is but voluntary, being to laſt only as long as vvee thinke good.) 4. <hi>Thoſe workes</hi> that true <hi>diſcretion</hi> requires of vs, &amp; vvhich to leaue vndone, or to doe contrary vvould be againſt <hi>Prudence.</hi> 5. <hi>Likewiſe</hi> vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it befalls vs to ſuffer from any creature vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, not excepting the deuill himſelfe, yea though it vvere by our ovvne fault that ſuch things hapned to vs, or vvere brought vpon vs. 6. <hi>Lastly thoſe things</hi> that vvee accept <hi>willingly</hi> of <hi>by vertue of an Interiour Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Impulſe,</hi> vvith the Approbation of our ſpirituall Father.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Voluntary Mortifications</hi> are ſuch as on our ovvne heads, &amp; vvithout the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48407:165"/> &amp; iudgment of thoſe that are acquainted vvith our Interiour, vvee voluntarily aſſume, or impoſe on our ſelues; either becauſe vvee haue ſeene or read of others that haue done the like, &amp; thervpon vvithout further due conſideration of our ovvne ſtate or abilities, vvee vvill hope they vvill aduance vs as much in the vvay of perfection: ſuch are <hi>Voluntary corporall fasts</hi> beyond vvhat the Church or Regular obſeruance doe require, <hi>Wearing of hairecloth, chaines,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>obstinate ſilence</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the times that the orders of the community doe appoint conuerſations &amp;c. To theſe may be abded an aſſuming <hi>the taske of ſaying ſo many Vocall Prayers, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This Diſtinction being premiſed, the deuout Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to take notice, that vvhatſoeuer hitherto hath or shall be ſpoken of the vſe, end &amp; benefits of <hi>Mortification</hi> is to be vnderſtood &amp; applied only to <hi>mortifications of neceſsity,</hi> and not to ſuch as are <hi>voluntary;</hi> And moreouer that all theſe Inſtructions &amp; Directions are intended only for ſuch ſoules (vvhether Religious or others) as are entred (or deſirous to enter) into an Internall courſe, tending to Contemplation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As touching therefore the former ſort of <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary mortifications,</hi> according to the vvhole latitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed, a deuout ſoule is to be exhorted (as being her duty &amp; obligation) vvith all courage &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to accept &amp; chearfully vndergoe them: conſidering that beſides the foremencioned ineſtimable Benefits at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them, they are of great ſecurity, free from all perill of errour, indiſcretion or pride.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:48407:166"/>6. <hi>But as for Voluntary mortifications</hi> (thoſe I meane vvhich are properly ſuch) vvee haue nothing to doe vvith them; yea moreouer I should neuer perſvvade a ſpirituall Diſciple to aſſume any conſiderable mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beſides ſuch as attend his preſent ſtate of life, till he can aſſure himſelfe that he has <hi>a good Call to</hi> them, that is, till after that hauing ſpent a conſiderable time in Internall prayer, he haue receiued light to iudge of their fitnes for him, &amp; Grace or ſpirituall ſtrength to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take &amp; purſue them chearfully; &amp; vvithall has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his Superiour or ſpirituall Directour. Yea though he had a body as ſtrong as <hi>Samſon</hi> &amp; vvithall a very good inclination to Internall vvaies, I should hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the firſt propoſer, mouer &amp; inciter of him to ſuch extraordinary mortifications (<hi>vnleſſe ſome ſpeciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> required them for a remedy againſt any ſpeciall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations then aſſalting him; In vvhich caſe they are not indeed to be eſteemed <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>ſupernumerary) but,</hi> conſidering the preſent ſtate, <hi>ordinary &amp; neceſſary.</hi>) Yea &amp; if ſuch an one should aske my counſell about the vſe of ſuch mortifications, &amp; vpon examination, I should find it to be doubtfull vvhether it vvas vpon <hi>a Diuine Inſpiration</hi> that he vvas moued to deſire them, I should take the ſurer courſe, that is, to diſſvvade him from the vndertaking of them.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It is true, vvee find in reading <hi>the liues of Saints</hi> that moſt of them haue practiſed them: &amp; many euen from their infancy. But this shevves that ſpirits fit for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mortifications are rarely to be found, being
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48407:166"/> only ſuch as God himſelfe leades after an extraordinary manner to make them Examples of the povver of his Grace, to the Edification of many, vſing them for his Inſtruments in great vvorkes. As for vs vvee are not to ſuppoſe that God eſteemes vs fit, or intends vs for ſuch extraordinary matters. Therfore it may ſuffiſe vs to vndergoe ſuch mortifications as God himſelfe has prouided for vs, beleiuing <hi>him</hi> to knovv vvhat is beſt for vs &amp; moſt proportionable.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In all <hi>our holy Rule</hi> there is no prouiſion nor order made for ſuch <hi>extraordinary</hi> or ſupernumerary morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, but only (in the 49. Cap.) about <hi>diet</hi> &amp; in the time of <hi>Lent</hi> &amp;c. And then it is forbidden to vndertake ſuch vvithout the Approbation of the Superiour: the neglect of vvhich Approbation is imputed to <hi>rashnes.</hi> For <hi>our holy Father,</hi> as he knevv the ineſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of mortifications vvhich come from God, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is exact in requiring conformity to the Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanded in the Rule; ſo on the other ſide vvas he not ignorant of the great inconueniences that probably attend the vndertaking ſuch extraordinary ones by imperfect ſoules, vvhich are commonly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereto, merely out of a fancy, humour or ſudden paſſion; for ſuch are ſeldome attended vvith any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God, vvho neither is obliged, nor ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vvill beſtovv his grace &amp; Spirituall ſtrength for the vndergoing of any morcifications, but ſuch as are ſent by him, or euidently <hi>ordained by his inſpiration;</hi> And experience vvitneſſes this, becauſe vvee ſeldome ſee ſoules to perſeuere in thoſe vvhich they aſſume by
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48407:167"/> their ovvne free election: And vvhiles they performe them, it is vvith little or no purity of Intention; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is, that <hi>our holy Father</hi> expreſsly declares, that the Diuine Inſpiration &amp; grace is to be acknovvledged the roote of all religious voluntary Auſterities, by thoſe vvords of his (Cap. 40.) <hi>Quibus donat Deus tolerantiam Abſtinentiae;</hi> That is; <hi>To whom God hath giuen the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or ſtrength to ſuffer extraordinary abstinence,</hi> Adding vvithall, that ſuch voluntary Abſtinences muſt be <hi>offred to God (cum gaudio Sancti Spiritus) with ioy of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Great caution</hi> therfore is to be vſed in the reading &amp; making vſe <hi>of Inſtructions &amp; examples</hi> found, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning this point, in ſpirituall Bookes; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe othervviſe a ſoule vvill be in danger to plunge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into great inconueniences &amp; difficulties; for vvhilſt she does imitate ſuch extraordinary practiſes, it is to be feared being yet imperfect, she vvill entertaine a proud conceipt of herſelfe; &amp; not receiuing Grace to perſeuere, she vvill be apt to dravv from thence matter of ſcrupuloſity &amp; deiection, ſo far as perhaps to become disheartned from further tendance in the vvay of the ſpirit. Yea ſuch a ſoule vvill be lyable to contract therby an obſcurity in her vnderſtanding (eſpecially if she be vnlearned) by vvhich she vvill become diſabled to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish <hi>Neceſſary Mortifications from voluntary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. It is a very hard, &amp; to many ſoules vvould proue a <hi>dangerous Aduice</hi> vvhich ſome <hi>Spirituall Authours</hi> giue, viz. That a Spirituall Diſciple should in euery thing that is of it ſelfe indifferent (in caſe that ſeuerall obiect;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48407:167"/> be offred to choyce) take that vvhich is moſt contrary to his naturall Inclination; As if many ſeuerall dishes vvere ſet before vs, to eate only that vvhich vvee leaſt like  &amp; thus to liue in a continuall contradiction &amp; croſſing of nature.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Surely no ſoules but ſuch as are in a good meaſure perfect, are capable of making good vſe of ſuch aduiſes, for only ſuch can vvith facility, diſcretion &amp; proffit practiſe them; As for the leſſe perfect, if they practiſe them vvith any vvillingnes, it is to be feared that the true ground is, becauſe therby they doe couertly comply vvith nature ſome orher vvay, nourishing ſelfe-eſteeme, contempt of others not ſo courageous, nor affording ſo great edification &amp;c:</p>
                        <p n="12">12. It vvere <hi>folly &amp; inexcuſable Pride</hi> for ſoules not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently &amp; faithfully purſuing Internall Prayer, &amp; not yet perfectly practiſing patience &amp; Reſignation in Croſſes &amp; neceſſary mortifications ſent by God, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their preſent condition of life; <hi>to attempt</hi> the vndertaking of thoſe vvhich belong not to them, but are merely deuiſed by themſelues. For vvanting a Diuine light, hovv can they perceiue or iudge them to be proper for them? And if they be vnable to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulties vvhich are ordinary &amp; neceſſary, vvhy should they thinke themſelues prepared for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ones? So that there is nothing vvhich makes theſe to be ſupportable, but only that they proceed from ſelfe-iudgment, &amp; ſelfe-vvill, &amp; by conſequence are more pleaſing then diſtaſtfull to nature.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The inconueniences attending the indiſcreet paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48407:168"/> vſe of ſuch Mortifications, are much greater in an Internall life tending to Contemplation, then in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue: <hi>Becauſe liberty of Spirit</hi> is much more neceſſary in the former, then in this latter. The vvhich <hi>Liberty</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely preiudiced by ſuch vnneceſſary obligations and fetters laid by a ſoule vpon herſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. And for this reaſon the <hi>ſupernumerary Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> vvhich may proue more vſefull, &amp; vvhich are leaſt preiudiciall to this <hi>Liberty,</hi> are thoſe that leaſt vvorke vpon the mind; as <hi>corporall labours,</hi> not of obligation, are more beneficiall then the ouer-multiplying of <hi>voluntary vocall Prayers,</hi> the practiſe vvherof vvill probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the true exerciſe not only of Internall recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but alſo of ſuch <hi>vocall Prayers</hi> as are of obligation. Aod of all others the moſt beneficiall are thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>not-doing,</hi> as more ſilence, more ſolitude &amp;c. then a perſon by regular ordinances is obliged to. Such Mortifications as theſe, if the perſon vſe diſcretion &amp; abſtaine from impoſing on himſelfe an obliging neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may ſometimes be proffitably vndertaken by more imperfect ſoules.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. I doe not therfore vvholly exclude euen imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſoules from the vſe of <hi>extraordinary Mortifications;</hi> for ſuch may be Gods vvill that they may vndertake them; and vpon that ſuppoſition moſt certaine it is that they vvill much haſten their aduancement to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As he that runns, if he be able to hold on, will ſooner come to his iourneyes end, then he that contents himſelfe vvith an ordinary trauelling pace. But if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly he vvill force himſelfe to run beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his breath
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48407:168"/> and ſtrength, that aduantage vvhich he got for a little vvhile, vvill not counteruaile the loſſe he ſuſtaines aftervvard.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Novv <hi>the ſignes and markes</hi> by vvhich a ſoule may informe herſelfe, <hi>whether the extraordinary Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications</hi> aſſumed by her <hi>doe proceed from a ſafe &amp; good principle,</hi> that is, from <hi>a Diuine Motiue,</hi> &amp; not an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of nature &amp; paſſion, may be theſe. <hi>She may esteeme them to come from God.</hi> 1. <hi>If she</hi> beare herſelfe vvell in the ordinary mortifications of neceſſity, ſupporting chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; courageouſly both the vſuall Auſterities of her Religious ſtate, &amp; alſo all accidentall croſſes. 2. <hi>In caſe it</hi> be vvith the aduice &amp; Approbation of her ſpirituall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour, that is skillfull in diſcerning of ſpirits. 3. <hi>If the ſoule</hi> in the continuance of it find a chearfullnes &amp; reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenes; for if there follovv any diſcontentednes or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, that is a very ill ſigne. 4. <hi>If the occaſion</hi> of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it vvas a quiet, conſtant Internall inuitation, &amp; not ſome ſudden humour of Paſſion, Remorſe, or ſome fitt of ſenſible Deuotion, or an ambition to imitate others &amp;c: Eſpecially if the matter of the Mortification haue any perill in it to corporall health &amp;c: for then the impulſe to vndertake it had need be very certaine &amp; ſtrong. 5. <hi>If by perſeuerance</hi> in it the vertue of <hi>Humility</hi> be increaſed. 6. <hi>Laſtly if it</hi> diſpoſe the ſoule to better Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, &amp; to a greater conſtancy &amp; feruour in Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. But to conclude this point, There are very fevv that need complaine of vvant of mortifications, or that are put to a neceſſity of ſeeking them. All obſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vvhatſoeuer, euen the leaſt that are practiſed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48407:169"/> or in the ſubmiſſion to a ſpirituall Directour; and much more all contradictions, humiliations &amp; Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are proffitable mortifications. Yea euen the <hi>Acts of Authority</hi> practiſed by <hi>Superiours</hi> if they be done (not out of nature, or a loue of commanding, but) in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Rule,</hi> &amp; vvith a foreſight that God vvill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an account concerning them, are ſuch alſo. And if all theſe be too little, <hi>a faithfull purſuance of Internall prayer, together with Abſtraction of life, will ſufficiently abate nature,</hi> &amp; vvill, no doubt (generally ſpeaking) be effectuall to bring ſoules to Perfection, if they liue out their due time; And if not, yet death finding them in the right way, vvill bring them to their deſired end. And laſtly, ſuch is the care &amp; tendernes of God tovvards ſoules that truely &amp; cordially conſecrate themſelues to him, that if theſe mortifications be not ſufficient, he will by a ſpeciall Prouidence procure others, &amp; ſuch as shall be moſt proper. Yea a very ſublime <hi>Mystick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> confidently proteſteth; <hi>That rather then ſuch a ſoule shall receiue preiudice by the want of them, God will by a miracle immediately prouide them, or by a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light &amp; forcible impulſe direct &amp; moue her to find them.</hi>

For this end a Religious ſoule leaues the vvorld; &amp; if she practiſe not Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Religion, she does as good as returne to that vvhich by profeſſion she has renounced.

                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>next</hi> generall mortification is <hi>Solitude,</hi> vvhich differs from Abſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only in this, that <hi>Solitude regards the exteriour,</hi> as <hi>Abſtraction does the Interiour;</hi> Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being an Internall ſolitude of the ſpirit; and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude an externall Abſtraction of the Perſon. Abſtraction may by feruent ſoules be practiſed in the midſt of the noyſe &amp; trouble of the vvorld, preſeruing themſelues from all engagement of their affections in buſineſſes or to Perſons, &amp; euer remaining free to attend vnto God. And on the contrary, ſome ſoules euen in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired externall ſolitude, doe vvholly plunge their minds &amp; affections in thoughts &amp; ſollicitudes about perſons &amp; buſineſſes abroad, by continuall endles vvriting &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvering letters, giuing Aduices, inquiring after nevves &amp;c: By vvhich meanes they doe more embroyle their minds, &amp; are leſſe capable of Spirituall conuerſation vvith God, then many that liue in the vvorld: by reaſon that their retired ſtate keeping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ignorance &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty about the ſucceſſe of their aduices &amp; correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, they are in a continuall ſollicitude about any thing, but their ovvne ſoules.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. So that if vvith Externall Solitude there be not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Internall Abſtraction &amp; Prayer, it is rather a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, then an Inſtrument of Aduancing Spirituall Perfection. Becauſe ſuch a ſoule is moreouer allvvaies at leaſure to attend to the obiect of her ſollicitudes, &amp;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48407:171"/> ſo rootes more fixedly all internall deordinations of Faction, Anger, Pride, ſelfe loue &amp;c. Hence vvee ſee that factions grovv ſometimes to a great violence in many retired communities, becauſe of the vacancy there to attend to them, the obiects of their paſſions likevviſe being, in a manner, continually preſent before their eyes.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. There is another vvhich may be called a <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Solitude,</hi> made uſe of by Religious Perſons, not vvith a deſigne the more freely to ſeeke God, but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their ſtudies, &amp; the enriching their minds vvith much knovvledge. Indeed <hi>Study &amp; reading</hi> vſed vvith diſcretion, &amp; if the matters about vvhich ſtudy is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed be not ſuch as are apt to puffe vp the mind vvith pride, or a forvvardnes to diſpute &amp; maintaine Topicall opinions &amp;c: may be no inconuenient Diuerſion for a contemplatiue ſpirit, eſpecially ſince that <hi>manuall labours</hi> haue bene diſuſed: But othervviſe an invvard affection to curioſity of knovvledge is perhaps <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> more preiudiciall to contemplation, &amp; produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces effects more hurtfull to the ſoule, becauſe more deepely rooted in the ſpirit it ſelfe, then ſome ſenſuall Affections.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The ſolitude therfore here recommended, and vvhich is proper to a Religious life, conſiſts in a ſerious affection to our <hi>Cell</hi> at all times vvhen conuentuall Duties doe not require the contrary; &amp; there admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no conuerſation but Gods, nor no employment but for God. <hi>Keepe thy Cell</hi> (ſaith <hi>an Ancient holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) &amp; thy Cell will teach thee all things.</hi> A ſoule that

                        <p n="9">9. Novv to the end that <hi>Solitude</hi> may in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning become leſſe tedious, &amp; aftervvards delightfull; Religious Perſons not only may, but ought to preſerue a conuenient &amp; diſcreet <hi>Liberty of Spirit</hi> about their employments &amp; entertainments of their minds in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, prudently vſing a variety in them, changing any one, vvhen it becomes ouer-burdenſome, into another more gratefull; ſometimes reading, ſometimes writing, other times vvorking, often praying: Yea if they shall find it conuenient, ſometimes remaining for a short ſpace in a kind of <hi>ceſsation</hi> from all both Externall &amp; Internall vvorking, yet euer being at leaſt <hi>in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Attention</hi> &amp; tendance <hi>to God,</hi> referring all to him &amp; his Glory.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48407:172"/> he anſvvered, <hi>Whatſoeuer thy mind according to God shall bid thee doe, that doe thou.</hi> And indeed after a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time vvell ſpent in Solitude, by the helpe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Prayer a ſoule vvill receiue a Diuine light, by vvhich she vvill clearely ſee vvhat shall be moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient &amp; proper for her at all times to doe.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Notvvitſtanding <hi>this caution</hi> is to be vſed, <hi>That</hi> if in any Employment a ſoule does find herſelfe caried to it vvith too much eagernes &amp; affection, she is to qualifie ſuch eagernes by forbearing, &amp; a vvhile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her preſent exerciſe, vvith a reſignation of her vvill to be quite debarred from it, if ſuch be Gods vvill for her good, &amp; actually referring it to God.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. It is very remarkable the great &amp; ſtudious care that <hi>our Holy Father</hi> in his <hi>Rule</hi> takes to recommend <hi>Solitude,</hi> &amp; to shevv the neceſſity of it; as likevviſe to imprint deepely in the minds of his diſciples not only a great auerſion, but euen a feare &amp; horrour of the vvorld. All things muſt be prouided &amp; executed vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dores <hi>(vt non ſit neceſsitas euagandi)</hi> that <hi>no neceſsity may force the Religious to be gadding abroad.</hi> And in caſe there should be an vnauoydable neceſſity therto, <hi>Prayers</hi> are appoynted to be made for thoſe that are to goe abroad, &amp; the like vvhen they returne home: Whither vvhen they come, they are ſtrictly forbidden to tell any nevves of their iourney. All this, as if by only ſtepping out of their incloſure they vvere expoſed to immediate perill; &amp; that it vvere not poſſible to haue bene in the vvorld vvithout contracting ſuch ſtaines, as that for the vvashing them avvay, <hi>Publicke prayers</hi> of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48407:172"/> vvere needfull. Such vvas the care expreſſed by our <hi>Holy Patriarke:</hi> vvho by ovvne experience had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the vvonderfull benefit, &amp; extreme neceſſity of Solitude for the attaining to Contemplation, according to that of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> by vvhoſe mouth <hi>God</hi> ſayes, (<hi>Oſe.</hi> cap. 4.) <hi>Ducam eam in ſolitudinem, &amp; loquar ad cor illius.</hi> That is, <hi>I will leade the deuour ſoule into a ſolitary place, and there I will ſpeake words of kindnes &amp; intimacy to her ſpirit.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe another <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith (Lament cap. 3.) <hi>(Sedebit ſolitarius &amp; tacebit quia le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauit ſe ſuper ſe.) The ſolitary perſon will ſit ſtill, &amp; hold his peace, becauſe he hath raiſed vp his ſpirit aboue himſelfe</hi> (&amp; all creatures.)</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Indeed vvhatſoeuer ſpirituall Employment a ſoule hath, &amp; vvhenſoeuer she deſires to haue any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation vvith God, <hi>Solitude</hi> is the ſtate moſt proper for it, vvhether it be to bevvaile her ſins; to exerciſe Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; to meditate on the holy ſcriptures; to prepare herſelfe for any employment: but eſpecially to exerciſe ſpirituall prayer freely.

                        <p n="2">2. Hervpon <hi>our Holy Father</hi> deales vvith his Diſciples, as God did vvith a certaine devout and <hi>Holy Monke,</hi> to whom he left no povver at all to vſe his tongue but only for prayer in the Community, being abſolutly dumbe in all other occaſions and times. For in <hi>our Holy Rule</hi> there ſeemes no Permiſſion allovved to particular Religious for any voluntary or recreatiue Diſcourſes at any times; no not to <hi>Superiours</hi> themſelues. And for ſpirituall diſcourſes by vvay of teaching, thoſe vvere on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allovved to the Abbot, or to certaine Seniours and Officers by the Abbots expreſſe appointment or leaue. And vvhen there hapned a neceſſity that an anſvver should be giuen by any of the private Religious, they vvere to deliuer it as breifely as vvas poſſible: If <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>nay</hi> vvould ſerue the turne, they muſt adde no more.

                        <p n="3">3.

                           <pb n="294" facs="tcp:48407:174"/>4. Now whether it were true, reall neceſſity, or no, that hath cauſed ſuch diſpenſations, I vvill not inquire. But this is certaine; that no ancienter then <hi>S.

And if Religious Perſons had truly good vvills to ſeeke God, they vvould find many things not very difficult, vvhich in their preſent diſpoſitions ſeeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, both in the point of <hi>Silence</hi> and alſo of <hi>Dyet</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Hovv euer this is certaine, that <hi>much and willing ſpeaking</hi> is the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>Tepidity, ſelfe-loue,</hi> and <hi>Pride.</hi> For commonly it flovves from an opinion that vvee can ſpeake vvell: and conſequently out of a deſire of gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eſtimation from others by shevving our vvits and abilities.

                        <p n="6">6.

                        <p n="7">7.

                        <p n="4">4. Neither ought a vvell-minded ſoule to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged or deiected at the contradiction that she finds in ſenſuality; But reſiſting it the beſt she can, she muſt be reſigned and Patient vvith herſelfe, as she vvould be at the refractory humours of another, till that by Gods bleſſing a longer exerciſe of Prayer and Mortification doe produce a greater ſubiection of ſenſuall Nature to

                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. During the <hi>Conflict</hi> betvveene Reaſon and ſence, or Appetite, there may be a reall <hi>Tranquillity</hi> in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Region of the ſoule, although the Perſon be not able to diſcerne that there is any ſuch Quietnes: yea on the contrary to fearfull Natures it vvill ſeeme that vvhenſoeuer the ſenſitiue part is diſturbed, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Portion doth alſo partake of its diſorders: And this vncertainty, miſtake and feare that a fault has bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted is the ground of much <hi>ſcrupuloſity,</hi> and by meanes therof, of great vnquietnes indeeed, euen in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſoule, to Perſons that are not vvell inſtructed in the Nature and ſubordination of the Faculties and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="6">6.

For example, vvhen a perſon being moued to <hi>Anger,</hi> though he find an vnquiet repreſentation in the Imrgination, and a violent heate and motions about the Heart, as likewiſe an auerſion in ſenſitiue nature againſt the perſon that

                        <p n="7">7. When vvee ſeeke to retaaine ſuch <hi>Quietnes</hi> in the midſt of vnquietnes, vvee doe it by exerciſing an Act of <hi>Mortification</hi> proper to the occaſion. Euery Act vvherof doth in ſome degree abate impetuous Nature, diſpoſing us for better and more quiet Recollections, vvhich vvill procure us a clearer light and more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Grace to reſiſt ſenſuality aftervvards. As on the contrary, each Act of immortification doth increaſe in us <hi>Selfe-loue</hi> (the cauſe and Roote of all vnquietnes) and cauſes a greater obſcurity in the ſoule, indiſpoſing it likevviſe to Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To the end to procure an <hi>Habituall Peacefullnes</hi> of mind, vvee muſt be carefull not to doe any of our Actions (I meane euen our <hi>Actions of Duty</hi>) vvith <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſnes</hi> and an invvard haſtines, but vvith a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed calmenes.

                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p>VVEE vvill novv conſider <hi>Charity</hi> vnder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion, as it is the <hi>Directour</hi> of all our Actions, and ſo it is called <hi>Purity of Intention:</hi> By vvhich vvee doe referre all that vvee doe or ſuffer to the Loue and Glory of God: vvhich is of all other the moſt <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Condition.</hi> For God revvards no deeds but ſuch as are done purely for his ſake. So that vvhatſoeuer other End vvee propoſe, vvhich is not Subordinate to this, makes the Action ſo far vnacceptable to him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I ſay, <hi>Subordinate:</hi> for doubtles there are &amp; muſt needs be, beſides this, <hi>other</hi> immediate <hi>Ends</hi> &amp; Intentions
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48407:188"/> of many of our Actions, as the Temporall or Spirituall good of our ſelues on others: But vvee are <hi>not to reſt</hi> in thoſe inferiour Ends, but to referre both the Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; them alſo finally vnto God. So <hi>our Sauiour</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>S. Peter</hi> to giue Tribute money, leaſt the Iewes should be offended.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wheras therfore ſome <hi>Spirituall Authours</hi> doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe vs <hi>to exclude</hi> the thought of all other Ends but only Gods Glory, from all our doings: yea ſo far, as that they vvould not ſcarſe permit one in Praying to mention himſelfe (Saying, <hi>O that I could loue thee, O my God &amp;c.</hi>) Wee are to ſuppoſe their meaning to be that, conſidering hovv forvvard &amp; ſubtile Nature is to intrude it ſelfe &amp; its intereſts in our beſt Actions, euen to the Excluſion of God (though vvee pretend other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe:) therfore being ſo imperfect as vvee are, our beſt courſe vvere to ſtudy (as much as may be vvith diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to forget our ſelues quite, and all other creatures. But ſurely if vvee vvere Perfect, vvee might vvithout vvrong to God, yea vvith the increaſe of our Loue to him, caſt an eye on all intermediate Ends.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Harphius</hi> makes a difference betvveene <hi>a Right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> and <hi>a Pure Intention:</hi> The former he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates to good <hi>Actiue Liuers,</hi> who according to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Actions, and generall purpoſe of their Hearts doe indeed in all things deſire to ſeeke Gods Glory: But yet for vvant of the practiſe of Pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Praier, they mixe many vndiſcouered Deſignes of nature in their good Actions, the vvhich doe ſo far abaſe the valevv of them. But <hi>the Intention of Perfect
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48407:188"/> Contemplatiue liuers</hi> he calls a <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Pure Intention,</hi> becauſe it proceeds from a purified Interiour.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Novv for the obtaining of ſuch <hi>a Pure</hi> and <hi>Simple Intention</hi> I vvill endeauour, according to my ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience &amp; the beſt Light that God has giuen me, to yeild the beſt Information &amp; helpe I can, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving Inſtructions, the vvhich doe properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſoules in a <hi>Contemplatiue</hi> Courſe. And they are to be regarded, and vſe in particular made of them, only ſo far as Deuout Soules shall find them to be proper &amp; proffitable for them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and as they are ſuitable to their <hi>Diuine Calls</hi> reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely, the vvhich are much more to be regarded then all humane Inſtructions.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Firſt</hi> therfore let a vvellminded Soule that leades an internall life, by reading, conferring, conſidering &amp; praying, get to vnderſtand the beſt she can, vvhat the true and Perfect loue of God is, and vvherin it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this being done, let her (by the Grace of God aſſiſting her) ſeriouſly purpoſe vvith her ſelfe (yet ſo as that she doe not fetter herſelfe by any <hi>Vowes</hi> or Obligations) by all the beſt meanes she can to labour for the attaining to the ſaid Loue of God: &amp; alſo pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Gods ſake &amp; to his Glory, &amp; no naturall Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of her ovvne, to intend the doing &amp; ſuffring of all things that she shall aftervvards doe or ſuffer.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Thirdly</hi> Since this Loue is only to be obtained by the meanes of <hi>Prayer</hi> &amp; <hi>Mortification,</hi> let her reſolue to abide in the proſecution of theſe according to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48407:189"/> here giuen, to her liues End: Not voluntarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in any degree of loue already attained, but ſtill proceeding further vvithout all limits. And this good Reſolution let her accordingly vvith courage put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution daily; Often renevving it vvhen she finds her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to become ſlack or negligent.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Laſtly</hi> in the Execution of theſe Duties and of all other her Employments, she muſt alvvaies haue at leaſt a <hi>vertuall</hi> Intention of directing them all to God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>him</hi> the finall End of all: and often times likevviſe she muſt frame <hi>an Actuall Intention</hi> of the ſame. Novv vvhen God is indeede, and in the true diſpoſition of the ſoule the End of her Actions, he communicates <hi>a Supernaturality</hi> &amp; a kind of <hi>Diuinity</hi> vnto them: And vnleſſe he be truly the End, they haue no merit at all.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Novv it being certaine that only by the practiſe of Internall Prayer this Purity of Intention can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: In vvhat danger are thoſe Soules that doe vvholly neglect it? Neither vvill a fevv interrupted <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall Offrings</hi> of our Actions to God be ſufficient to procure a Stable habit of ſuch Purity, vvithout conſtant ſett Exerciſes of Praier &amp; Mortification: All the vertue that ſuch <hi>Oblations</hi> haue, is a litle to diminish the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe particular Actions, but they doe not at all (or very inconſiderably) increaſe or ſtrengthen the Habit of Diuine Loue in the Soule. The vertue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſuch Acts is to be meaſured according to the ſtate that the ſoule is in.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. If an Internall liuer doe practiſe ſuch occaſionall Offrings of daily Actions, I should aduiſe him 1. <hi>Not
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48407:189"/> to multiply</hi> ſuch Acts too thicke one vpon the other, ſo as to endanger to hurt the Head, or diſtract the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or hinder the neceſſary liberty of Spirit. 2. <hi>Let not them</hi> be a hindrance to other more perfect &amp; proffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Eleuations</hi> of the Spirit to God, or <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> if the ſoule find herſelfe inuited therto, or if they be rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing to her.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. It is vnqueſtionable, that <hi>the offring of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings to God</hi> vvill be far more proffitable to the ſoule, then the <hi>Offring</hi> of <hi>mere Workes,</hi> that haue in them litle or nothing contrary to our Naturall Inclinations. Yet euen <hi>that</hi> alſo vvithout conſtant Praier vvill be of litle force.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. I dare vvith confidence profeſſe, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the foreſaied Simple Directions vvill be far more auaileable to the procuring Purity of intention in moſt ſoules, then ſuch a curious Examination of our daily vvorks as is preſcribed by a late vvorthy Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of our Nation, vvho requires in euery vvorke <hi>Sixe Qualities</hi> punctually to be obſerued, viz. That it be done. 1. <hi>Actually:</hi> 2. <hi>One<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Which ſurely vvould be an Employment extreamly diſtractiue, and full of Sollicitude. Though it may be <hi>he himſelfe</hi> found much good by ſuch a practiſe, and vvas able to doe it vvith Simplicity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is far more eaſy for an Imperfect ſoule to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48407:190"/> Purity of Intention in Actions that are of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; done either in Order to any <hi>Law,</hi> or any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Superiours, then in thoſe that are left to her ovvne Choice: And therfore it vvould be good for ſuch an one, either to haue her daily &amp; ordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments preſcribed to her by her Spirituall Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour; or to ordaine them to her ſelfe vpon good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration before hand: yet ſo as not to preiudice due <hi>Liberty of Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">15. In euery <hi>Recollection</hi> the ſoule doth either direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; <hi>expreſsly,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>vertually</hi> renew her <hi>firſt Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Purpoſe</hi> of tending in all her Actions, Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Internall, to the perfect Loue of God: and then alſo she diſcouereth &amp; correcteth ſuch defects and tranſgreſſions of this Purpoſe as haue paſſed out of the times of Praier. <hi>Our Recollections</hi> therfore are <hi>the Fountaine</hi> &amp; Roote vvhence all our future vvorks haue their vertue &amp; merit: &amp; in them Purity of Intention is moſt perfectly Exerciſed.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. The doings or ſuffrings of a Contemplatiue liuer, though oft times vvith much repugnancy in inferiour Nature, yet doe partake more of Purity of Intention &amp; Merit, then the voluntary Actions of Actiue liuers, or of one that does not conſtantly purſue Internall Prayer: albeit the actions of <hi>theſe</hi> doe ſeeme to be done vvith greater alacrity &amp; facility, &amp; to the doer ſeeme to proceede purely out of Charity, and vvithall cauſe great admiration in the eyes of the Beholders: The reaſon is, becauſe the Actions of the <hi>former</hi> are done purely out of a Diuine Inſpiration, and alſo in great Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48407:190"/> &amp; vnity, their regard to God being not hindred by the Images accompanying ſuch Actions: Wheras <hi>Actiue liuers</hi> immediatly contemplate <hi>Multiplicity:</hi> Yea in Praier it ſelfe they are not vvithout Multiplicity, though they doe direct that Multiplicity more directly to <hi>one,</hi> then in Actions out of Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Now ſince Purity of Intention conſiſts in regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God vvith Simplicity, that is, vvithout mixture of Images, or affections to Creatures, it concerns Internall liuers to vſe as great care &amp; Diſcretion as may be, not to intrude themſelues vnneceſſarily into Diſtractiue Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Euen the moſt Perfect Soules are apt to haue leſſe Purity of Intention in things gratefull to Nature, then in ſuch as are Mortifying: Therfore in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they may doe vvell to frame an Actuall vpright Intention.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. The repugnancy that Contemplatiue liuers doe find oftimes in the diſcharge of Externall Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proceeds not ſo much out of any unvvillingnes to obey, as out of an auerſnes from leauing their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Solitude and Abſtraction: Yet ſuch repugnancy in inferiour Nature is eaſily ſubdued, at leaſt ſo far that it shall not be a hindrance to Obedience and Duty.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. True <hi>Purity of Intention,</hi> is beſt diſcerned in the beginning of an Action: For ordinarily vvee ſett v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Externall vvorkes out of a ſudden impulſe and liking of Nature: And afterwards vvee couſen our ſelues vvith a forced good intention faſtned vpon them, ſo thinking that in them vvee doe purely ſeeke the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48407:191"/> glory of God, and faintly renouncing our intereſts of Nature. It is indeede better to doe thus, then to continue ſuch Actions vpon the ſame Motiues vpon vvhich they vvere begun. But no Actions are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meritorious and pure, but ſuch as haue for their <hi>firſt Principle</hi> a Diuine Light &amp; impulſe, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in vertue of the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. Therfore a certaine <hi>Antient</hi> holy <hi>Hermite</hi> vvas accuſtomed before he ſet vpon any vvorke, to make a pauſe for ſome time, like one vvhoſe thoughts vvere buſied about ſome other matter: And being asked vvhy he did ſo: He anſvvered: <hi>All our Actions are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues nothing worth. But like a rough vnshapen peice of Timber, they haue no Gracefullnes in them vnleſſe wee adorne &amp; guild them ouer with a Pure Intention, directing them to the Loue &amp; Glory of God. Or as one that is to shoote at a Marke, doth firſt carefully fixe his eye vpon it, otherwiſe he will shoote at randome: So do I fixe my Eye vpon God who is to be our only Marke: and for this reaſon before I begin any worke, I doe ſeriouſly offer it to God, begging his aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="22">22. <hi>Actiue liuers</hi> had neede in almoſt all their Actions of moment to frame an <hi>Actuall Intention:</hi> but not ſo the <hi>Contemplatiue,</hi> vvho are alvvaies habitually vnited to God: For ſuch iterations of Actuall intention vvould cauſe too much diſtraction to them.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. To Conclude, hovv difficult and vneaſy ſoeuer to Nature the attaining to Purity of Intention be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therby the very Soule of Corrupt Nature (vvhich is <hi>Propriety</hi>) is rooted out: Yet ſince it is abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48407:191"/> in an Internall life, therfore conſidering Gods promiſe, that he neuer vvill be vvanting to our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, Soules of good vvills vvill find it neither impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nor of ſo great Difficulty, as at firſt it appeared, if they vvill attempt it vvith a ſtrong Reſolution. To quicken &amp; fortifie vvhich Reſolution, I vvill end this Diſcourſe vvith that peircing ſaying of <hi>Harphius: O how great and hidden deceits of Corrupt Nature will appeare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and be diſcouered</hi> (and conſequently be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely punished) <hi>after this life, for that Soules haue not here bene purified and made Deiforme in their Intentions.</hi> God Almighty giue vs the grace to diſcouer novv and reforme this perillous and ſecret ſelfe-ſeeking of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to the Glory of his Holy Name.

                           <pb n="331" facs="tcp:48407:192"/>1. BEFORE Wee end the Subiect of <hi>Diuine Loue</hi> ſomething is to be ſaid of <hi>Loue to our Selues,</hi> &amp; <hi>our Neighbours</hi> in and for <hi>God:</hi> For as for the loue vvhich out of God vvee beare to our Selues, or any others, it is not vvorth the treating of, as being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defectuous and grounded in Nature; And the more vehement it is, the more defectuous is it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The right Ordring</hi> therfore <hi>of. Our loue to our Selues</hi> and our <hi>Brethren</hi> conſiſts in this 1. <hi>That the Motiue</hi> of our loue muſt be the Diuine vvill &amp; Command. 2. <hi>The ground</hi> therof muſt be the relation in vvhich vvee ſtand to God, as capable of the Communication of Diuine Graces and Beatitude. 3. <hi>The End</hi> muſt be to bring our Selues and others (either by our Endeauours, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions &amp;c. or by our Praiers) to God, that he may be loued &amp; Glorified by vs: in the doing of vvhich conſiſts our Perfection &amp; Happines. 4. <hi>Laſtly the ſubiect of this Loue</hi> muſt be the Superiour vvill eſpecially: As for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of nature, diſtracting ſollicitudes &amp; vnquiet images in the minde touching thoſe vvee loue, the beſt &amp; ſafeſt courſe vvould be to mortify &amp; diminish them as much as may be, as proceeding from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſenſuall affection, the vvhich as far as it does not flovv from the Superiour ſoule, &amp; is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate &amp; directed to the loue of God, is defectuous.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hence appeares <hi>Firſt, That affections in Perſons that are ſtrangers from the true Faith,</hi> are full of defectuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all the particular reſpects before mentioned.

                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly it followes</hi> from hence, that vvee can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meritoriouſly loue our ſelues, nor our Brethren, till firſt vvee are firmely rooted in the loue of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Charity</hi> to our ſelues, or others, is indeed only <hi>loue to God by Reflection,</hi> or the louing of God in things belonging to him, &amp; vvhich he either loues or may loue.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Therfore an Internall liuer ought to mortify all ſenſuall affection to creatures; I meane, all particular <hi>freindships</hi> &amp; intimacies vvhich are not grounded vpon the neceſſary foundation of the Diuine Loue: And as for ſuch affections as are neceſſarily due by vertue of ſome reſpects &amp; relations that God has put betvveene our ſelues &amp; any others, ſuch an one ought, as much as may be, to roote them out of the ſenſuall portion of the ſoule: becauſe there they vvill cauſe great diſtractions &amp; hindrances of our moſt neceſſary loue to God.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A ſerious care to practiſe according to this Aduice is very neceſſary, eſpecially in <hi>Religious Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munities,</hi> both for our ovvne good &amp; others. For beſides that <hi>ſenſuall freindships</hi> grounded on externall or ſenſuall reſpects
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48407:194"/> are moſt vnbeſeeming Perſons that haue conſecrated themſelues only to God, &amp; infinitly preiudiciall to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction &amp; recollectednes of mind: &amp; much more if they be betweene Perſons of different ſexes: ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intimatcies cannot chuſe but cauſe particulities, factions, particular deſignes &amp;c: to the great diſturbance &amp; harme of the Community.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The leaſt defectuous amongſt the grounds of a particular friendship may be the reſentment &amp; gratitude for benefits, eſpecially ſpirituall ones, that haue ben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. But yet euen in this caſe alſo, vvee ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the ſettling of amity in the ſenſuall part of the ſoule, &amp; content our ſelues vvith requiting ſuch obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations by our Prayers, or by a returne of proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefits.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Novv <hi>Charity</hi> is to be extended to all <hi>Intellectuall Creatures,</hi> that is, to all <hi>Angells,</hi> &amp; <hi>all men</hi> vvhether <hi>aliue</hi> or <hi>dead:</hi> except only <hi>the reprobate Angells</hi> &amp; <hi>damned ſoules, which are not obiects of our Charity,</hi> in as much as they are not capable of enioying God, vvhich is the ground of Charity. And the effects of our Charity to the <hi>glorified Saints &amp; Angells</hi> muſt be a congratulation vvith them for their happines, &amp; for the loue vvhich they beare to God, &amp; vvhich God vvill eternally beare reciprocally to them. To all <hi>Chriſtians dying in the faith</hi> of <hi>our Lord,</hi> &amp; not yet purified, vvee muſt teſtify our Charity by Praying for them, &amp; doing all other Chriſtian Offices of ſacrifices, Almes &amp;c: for the aſſwaging &amp; shortning of their ſuffrings in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> For <hi>all Christians aliue,</hi> yea <hi>all men,</hi> vvee muſt pray for graces ſuitable to their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities:

And if to others, much more muſt vvee expreſſe all theſe effects of Charity to our ſelues.

                        <p n="12">12.

As for other men, certaine generall duties of this nature are vpon occaſions only to be exhibited towards all: Hence vvee are generally commanded to <hi>Exhort, Edifie, Reproove</hi> &amp;c. one an other: But theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to be the employment &amp; particular <hi>charge</hi> only of thoſe that God hath called to the care of ſoules: yet ſo as that no ſoules are ſo ſtrictly intruſted to any one, as his ovvne, ſo that vpon no pretence can it be lavvfull for any one to neglect the care of his ovvne ſoule.

It may be demanded, <hi>Whether externall corporall endowments,</hi> as <hi>youth, beauty, gracefullnes</hi> &amp;c: <hi>may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter as a motiue into the loue that wee beare to others?</hi> I anſvver, that ſuch corporall perfections being Gifts of God, may lavvfully, as ſuch, be motiues of loue, namely, to thoſe that are ſo perfect, as that they can vſe them as ſteps to aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by them to a higher &amp; purer loue of God in and for them, vvho is <hi>beauty</hi> it Selfe. But as for <hi>imperfect</hi> &amp; <hi>ſenſuall Perſons</hi> it vvould be vnlawfull &amp; a tempting of God to giue a free &amp; deliberate ſcope to their loue of others (ſpecially of different ſexes) for the regard of beauty: ſince vvee knovv it vvill powerfully vvithdraw their affections from God, &amp; fixe them on creatures after the fovvleſt manner. Therfore the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary care of our ſelues requires, that vvee should not ſo much as looke ſtavedly &amp; fixedly on the tentation of beauty; much leſſe fauour the attraction of it.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Before vvee conclude this ſo neceſſary a point concerning Charity: ſome vvhat is to be ſayd touching the moſt Chriſtian duty of <hi>loue to our Enemies,</hi> True it is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48407:198"/> that the loue of Chriſt vvill not permit vs to exerciſe enmity towards any Perſon in the leaſt degree, ſince <hi>Charity</hi> is to be vniuerſally extended to all: But <hi>enemies I call thoſe</hi> that are in their nature auerſe from vs, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by ſome prouocation; or that are indeed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our Holy Profeſſion, or that vvould dravv vs to ſin &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. As for theſe latter ſort of <hi>enemies,</hi> they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed truly ſuch; and their actions vvee muſt abhorre, &amp; alſo vvith diſcretion auoyd their company: but vvee muſt <hi>not hate their perſons,</hi> nor be vvanting in any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Charity towards them, when occaſion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. But touching the former ſort, of thoſe that (as it is to be hoped) vvithout an vtter breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doe in externall matters doe ill offices to vs, or are contrary to our deſignes: ſuch vvee ought to eſteeme as indeed our freinds: &amp; perhaps if vvee regard the proffit of our ſoules, vvee could leſſe ſpare them, then thoſe vvee call our moſt <hi>officious freinds,</hi> vvho doe but flatter or nourish ſelfe-loue in vs. It is only as to <hi>the feeling of nature</hi> that vvee eſteeme ſuch to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: But really vvee are to behaue our ſelues towards them as Gods Inſtruments for our great good: Yea &amp; as far as prudence vvill permit, vvee are to iudge &amp; beleiue that they loue vs, &amp; intend our good in things that they doe croſſe to our nature.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Now till vvee come to a perfect ſimplicity of thought (vvhich vvill not be till vvee approach to a ſtate of Perfection:) vvee muſt be carefull neither by
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48407:199"/> vvords nor deeds to procure them the leaſt harme in any kind: no not ſo much as in thought to vvish it them. On the contrary, vvee muſt loue them ſtill; &amp; principally for this, becauſe God loues them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires their ſaluation: vvhich (it is to be hoped) he vvill effectually procure.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. But to doe an office ſo neceſſary, yet vvithall ſo contrary to the inclinations of corrupt nature, a great meaſure of grace is requiſite: the vvhich is not to be had vvithout anſvverable efficacious Internall Praier ſeriouſly purſued: the vvhich ioyned vvith good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage tovvards them forth of the times of Praier, vvill in time abſtract the ſoule from inferiour paſſions, &amp; that inordinate ſelfe-loue, vvhich is the roote of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to ſuch enemies: And <hi>Diuine Loue</hi> encreaſing, it vvill proportionally ſubdue all other affections to it ſelfe, &amp; euen compell vs to loue our enemies for God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt perfect example of <hi>our Sauiour.</hi> And he that thinks to get this neceſſary loue to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (or indeed any other Chriſtian vertue) in any conſiderable perfection vvithout ſpirituall Praier, vvill find that he vvill looſe his labour.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. <hi>The Degrees of our loue to</hi> (ſuppoſed) <hi>enemies</hi> are ſuch as follovv: 1. <hi>The firſt and loweſt degree</hi> is, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our ſelues on them, nor to render euill for euill, by vvord or deede, in their preſence or abſence, priuily or publickly &amp;c: (Indeede vvee ought to behaue our ſelues vvith-much vvarines tovvards thoſe that in nature vvee find an auerſenes from: ſo as that it vvee cannot as yet conquer the reſentments of nature, vvee
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48407:199"/> vvere beſt to eſchevv medling in matters that concerne them) 2. <hi>Not to be angry or</hi> offended for any ill offices that they may ſeeme to haue done us. 3. <hi>To forgiue them</hi> vvhenſoeuer they craue pardon. 4. <hi>To forgiue them</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they acknowledge their fault, or ſeeke to make amends. 5. <hi>Not to be contriſtated</hi> at their Proſperity, nor deny any offices of Charity to them: but to Pray for them, to ſpeake vvell of them; &amp; to doe kindneſſes to them; to congratulate for any good ſucceſſes of theirs, &amp; be cordially ſorry for their miſfortunes &amp;c: 6. <hi>To ſeeke occaſions</hi> of doing them ſome ſpeciall good; yea &amp; for the procuring ſuch good, to vndergoe ſome diſcommodity, loſſe or preiudice. 7. <hi>To take part</hi> in their proſperities or aduerſities, as if they vvere our ovvne. 8. <hi>After the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord,</hi> to hazzard &amp; euen lay dovvne our liues for their ſoules good. 9. <hi>To conquer all reſentment</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in inferiour Nature: <hi>And in Simplicity of ſoule to iudge</hi> all their ill offices to be effects of their Charity, &amp; not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſenes. (Yet I doubt vvhether euen in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the loue to enemies can come to be transfuſed into inferiour nature from the ſuperiour ſoule, as our loue immediatly to God ſometimes may be.) 10. <hi>To doe all this</hi> purely for the loue of God. Theſe things vvee ought to doe the beſt vvee can: &amp; God vvill accept of our good vvill, though our actions be not ſo perfect as vvee vvould vvish they vvere.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. By ſuch Chriſtian &amp; Charitable behauiour tovvards our Enemies, ſuch a <hi>Diuine vertue</hi> vvill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our actions, that vvee shall come to gaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perhaps to be our beſt freinds, yea (vvhich is far more
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48407:200"/> conſiderable) vvee shall probably gaine them to God, if before they vvee eſtranged from him.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. To conclude this vvhole diſcourſe: Wee are to knovv that there is a peculiar <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Charity, vvhich <hi>S.

                           </hi> ſcarce any tentation more ſubtile: For it doth ſo cloake it ſelfe vnder the title of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> that euen the moſt perfect ſoules vvhich haue abandonned all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet being impriſoned in bodies that neede <hi>dayly Refection,</hi> are continually expoſed to this, &amp; oft ſurpriſed &amp; in ſome meaſure ouercome by it: <hi>not being able to diſtinguish exceſse from neceſsi y</hi> Hence <hi>S.

                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>naturall Appetite</hi> deſires foode merely for the ſuſtaining of nature. <hi>The ſenſuall,</hi> merely for pleaſure, not conſidering benefit either to ſoule or body; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the ſeaſonablenes of the time, nor any other due circomſtance; But <hi>the Rationall appetite</hi> or <hi>Will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Grace,</hi> though it cannot hinder ſenſuality from taking pleaſure in food &amp;: yet deſires &amp; receiues it out of a neceſſary care of ſupporting the <hi>body</hi> for the good of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> according to the vvill &amp; pleaſure of

So that if the Rationall part giue vvay to the inordinate deſires of ſenſuality, ſo far there is a fault committed: the vvhich is not to be imputed to Senſuality, but to the Superiour ſoule, vvhoſe office it is to reſtraine &amp; bridle Sence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This <hi>tentation,</hi> as it is <hi>the laſt</hi> that is perfectly ouercome, ſo it is <hi>the first</hi> that is to be combatted againſt. For <hi>there is no vertue had</hi> (ſaith <hi>Caſsian) till a ſoule come to haue ſome degree of maistry ouer herſelfe in the point of Gluttony.</hi> And the maine miſcheife of the tentation is preuented, vvhen vvee are come to <hi>cast of the habituall affection to eating &amp; drinking,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to feaſting; the vvhich brings many inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to an Internall liuer; as 1. <hi>loſſe of time.</hi> 2. <hi>Perill of intemperance</hi> &amp; other misbehauiour. 3. <hi>Hurtfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions.</hi> 4. <hi>Indiſpoſition to</hi> Prayer 5. <hi>Intemperance</hi> likevviſe in another vſe of the <hi>tongue,</hi> to vvit, <hi>talking</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Imperfecter ſoules therfore muſt make it their care in Refections to auoyd theſe ſpeciall defects.

                        <p n="6">6.

                        <p n="7">7. This one vnauoydable miſery there is in eating &amp; drinking, hovv temperatly ſoeuer, That a ſoule for ſuch a time, &amp; for ſome ſpace aftervvards, is forced to deſcend from that height of Spirit that she had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to by vertue of her precedent Recollection.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48407:202"/> So that if before she had a ſight &amp; experimentall perception that <hi>God was all, &amp; herſelfe nothing;</hi> she vvill aftervvards haue no other ſight of this, but her ordinary ſight of Faith: by reaſon that her Spirits are more actiue; &amp; her internall ſenſes filled vvith Images &amp; vapours.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Yet a ſoule is <hi>not to abridge</hi> herſelfe of a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quantity in Refection, for her Prayers ſake, or other Internall Exerciſes: for that vvould for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe more harme to the ſpirit, by too much enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the body. Neither is she to iudge that she has offended by exceſſe, becauſe she finds a heauines, and perhaps ſome indigeſtion for ſome ſpace after Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For this may proceed from that debility of complexion vvhich ordinarily attends a ſpirituall life: ſince, as <hi>S.

                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9.

Gregory) A perfect ſoule doth ſcarce diſcerne the ſecret Tentations, &amp; ſubtle ſubreption of ſenſuality vrging ſoules to take more then neceſsity or obedience require:</hi> &amp; the only light ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſuch <hi>diſcerning</hi> comes from internall Praier. And moreouer till the ſoule by Praier be rayſed aboue ſenſuality, she cannot haue ſtrength enough to reſiſt all the inordinate deſires therof vvhich she doth diſcerne. And vvhen ſoules are arriued to Perfect Praier of Contemplation, they oppoſe ſuch deſires rather by <hi>neglecting</hi> &amp; forgetting the body, then by direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats againſt the appetits of it. And only from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay &amp; ignorance of ſuch Praier hath it proceeded, that ſpirituall Directours haue bene forced to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch &amp; ſo many nice obſeruances about diet and other duties of <hi>our Rule:</hi> All vvhich notvvithſtanding,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48407:204"/> vvithout Prayer haue but ſmall effect to produce ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide vertues in the ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. A ſoule perfectly ſpiritualized, if she might haue her vvish, vvould vvillingly be freed, not only from all pleaſures taken in Refections, (conſidering the dayly tentations to exceſſe:) but euen from the neceſſity of them, being forced to cry out vvith <hi>Dauid (De neceſsitatibus meis erue me, Domine)</hi> O <hi>Lord, free mee from theſe my corporall neceſsities:</hi> for vvere it not for them, she might alvvaies, like <hi>an Angell,</hi> be in continuall Contemplation, &amp; enioy a neuer-fayling internall light, the vvhich is obſcured by the fumes rayſed euen by the moſt temperate Refections: by vvhich alſo paſſions are in ſome degree quickned. Such ſoules may indeed properly be ſaid to haue <hi>a disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to Refection. And the beſt vvay beſides, &amp; out of Prayer to beget ſuch disaffection, &amp; to preuent the harmes that may come from any corporall neceſſities, vvill be not only to practiſe the mortifying of ſenſuall contentment in going to the Refectory, but vpon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of the Tentations there to be found, to goe vvith a kind of vnvvillingnes &amp; feare.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. A moſt <hi>noble kind of Mortification in Refection</hi> is that mencioned by <hi>Harphius</hi> of a certaine <hi>Holy Brother of the Order</hi> of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> called <hi>Rogerius,</hi> vvho by meanes of eleuating the povvers of his ſoule &amp; ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending them in God during Refection, loſt all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of taſt in eating; &amp; vvhen he found himſelfe vnable ſo to eleuate his ſoule, he vvould for ſo long forbeare to eate of any thing that might afford any
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48407:204"/> guſt. But this practiſe belongs only to the <hi>Perfect:</hi> it may proue preiudiciall &amp; dangerous to the ordinary ſort of leſſe perfect ſoules, or any that haue not an eſpeciall &amp; certaine Inſpiration to imitate it.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. The like may be ſayd of the <hi>manner of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> practiſed by ſome of the <hi>Ancient Hermits,</hi> vvho vſed to mixe a fevv droppes of oyle (eſteemed by them a great delicacy) vvith their vinegar, to the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prouoke the appetite to deſire more, the vvhich they denied to it. Or of <hi>another,</hi> vvho hauing receiued a bunch of grapes, ravenouſly deuoured them, partly to make the guſtfull pleaſure ſo much the shorter, &amp; partly, (as he ſaid) to couſen the deuill, to vvhom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to appeare a glutton.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. A ſoule that practiſes Internall Prayer may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herſelfe vvith a moderate Attention to vvhat <hi>is read</hi> during Refection. And the like may be ſayd of that part of the Office vvhich in ſome Communities is ſayd immediatly after Dinner. Becauſe too earneſt an Attention and Recollectednes at ſuch times vvould preiudice the Head and Stomack. A Soule therfore may eſteeme this to be as a time of <hi>Deſolation:</hi> as indeed there is ſome reſemblance.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Concerning the vſe of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> &amp; cautions to be vſed about it: ſome Inſtructions shall be giuen in the <hi>laſt Treatiſe,</hi> vvhere vvee come to ſpeake hovv a ſoule is to behaue herſelfe in regard of her Prayer, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Sicknes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">21. Laſtly the matter of <hi>Sleepe</hi> is not vvnvvorthy the eare of a Spirituall Perſon. For certaine it is that a full
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48407:205"/> repaſt doth not ſo much plunge a ſoule in ſenſuality, nor ſo indiſpoſe her for Spirituall Exerciſes, as a long &amp; profound <hi>Sleepe:</hi> From vvhence euen a perfect ſoule vvill not be able to raiſe herſelfe into Exerciſes of the Spirit vvithout much difficulty &amp; long ſtriuing.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE <hi>next Paſsion</hi> to be mortified is <hi>Anger,</hi> the vvhich vvhoſoeuer vvillingly ſuffers to ariſe &amp; increaſe, or that deliberatly yeilds to trouble of mind for any matter that concernes the Body, Health, Fortunes, Life &amp;c, yea or pretended ſoules good: ſuch an one really makes more eſteeme of them then of the ſolide good of his Soule: For as far as <hi>Anger</hi> gets a Maiſtery ouer him, ſo far he looſes that Dominion that his Soule ought to haue ouer all other things, &amp; puts Reaſon out of its Throne: Herupon our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſayth, <hi>In patientia vestra poſsidebitis animas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stras:</hi>
                           <pb n="357" facs="tcp:48407:206"/> That is, <hi>By Patience yee shall keepe the Poſseſsion of your Soules:</hi> as implying, that by <hi>Impatience</hi> vvee looſe that poſſeſſion: And vvhat greater loſſe can vvee haue? Hence it is alſo that almoſt in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages he that is in any great impatience, is ſayd to be <hi>out of himſelfe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Novv the <hi>Aduices</hi> vvhich I shall giue for the repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Impatience doe not regard thoſe great exceſſes of <hi>Fury</hi> too common in the vvorld, though it is to be hoped, vnknovven in an Internall State: But only thoſe <hi>leſser inordinate Paſsions of Impatience</hi> and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, or thoſe ſmaller <hi>Impetuoſities of nature</hi> which may ſometimes befall deuout Soules, by vvhich the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>Peace of mind</hi> is diſturbed, the habit of Propriety encreaſed, and the merit euen of our beſt vvorkes of Obligation diminished.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As vvee ſayd that <hi>Loue</hi> (vvhich is the Roote of all other Paſſions &amp; Affections) is due only to and for God; ſo conſequently all Paſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Loue, all Auerſions, impatiences &amp;c. are to be directed only againſt that vvhich is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God: the vvhich <hi>no Perſons</hi> are, nor no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or ſuffrings, vvhich are not ſinfull. Therfore all ſuch Paſſions againſt any Perſons vvhatſoeuer, or any accidents be falling vs from any, are inordinate &amp; ſinfull, to the proportion and meaſure of the ſayd Paſſions.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Euen the moſt <hi>Solitary liuer</hi> vvill not haue reaſon to complaine of vvant of occaſions to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Patience: For beſides the Croſſes hapning by Gods
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48407:207"/> Prouidence from vvithout (againſt vvhich all impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is interpretatiuely impatience againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:) A ſoule aſpiring to Perfection muſt obſerue euen the ſmalleſt Motions paſſing in the heart, the vvhich vvill be apt to riſe euen againſt the vileſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as vermine, flyes &amp;c. yea inanimate things, as Penns, Inke &amp;c. There are alſo certaine <hi>Propenſions in the will</hi> vvithout any perceptible Motion about the heart, ſo ſecret &amp; ſubtile that they can hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the vvhich perfect Soules by the Light pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Prayer, doe diſcerne and contradict. None are vvholly free from theſe inordinations; euen the moſt quiet natures vvill find vnequall inclinations, vvhich they ought to mortify.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Such is the difference,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſsian, betweene a Perfect Internall liuer and one that is imperfect, as there is betwene a Cleare-ſighted man and one that is purblind.</hi> A <hi>purblind man</hi> in a roome ſees only the groſſer things, as <hi>Chaires, Tables</hi> &amp;c. but takes no notice of an infinite number of ſmaller matters, vvith their Colours, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Order &amp;c. all vvhich are plainly diſtinguished by a <hi>Cleare-ſighted Man,</hi> vvho vvill obſerue many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and inequalities inuiſible to others. So it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our invvard defects. An <hi>imperfect ſoule</hi> only takes Notice of <hi>groſſer</hi> imperfections, and ſtriues to amend them only: And that being done, conceiues her ſelfe arriued to great Perfection: vvhen, alas, there yet remaines a vvorld of Imperfections, only viſible to Eyes enlightned vvith Supernaturall Grace (to be obtained only by Pure Internall Prayer) the vvhich vvill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48407:207"/> hovv ſtrangely rooted &amp; deeply fixed all Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are in the Soule: And hovv ſoules deceiue themſelues, vvho in proſperity doe ſo vvholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelues to <hi>Ioy,</hi> as if nothing could happen that could diminish it: and contrarily in ſorrow: As vvee find Examples in <hi>Suſo,</hi> and the <hi>Monke</hi> cured from a great invvard Affliction by <hi>S. Bernard:</hi> as likevviſe in <hi>Dauid</hi> vvho ſayth of himſelfe: <hi>Ego dixi in exceſſu meo &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Being in an Exceſſe of mind through Diuine conſolation I ſayd, I shall neuer be moued:</hi> But he found preſently hovv he vvas miſtaken, for it follovves; <hi>(Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſti faciem tuam &amp;c.) Thou only didst turne thy face from mee, and preſently I became troubled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Therfore Spirituall Perſons at all times muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Patience, euen in times of Ioy, by expecting a Change therof: vvhich perhaps is to be deſired; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vvay to Perfection is by a continuall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mountings and deſcendings: to all vvhich they muſt be indifferent; or rather they muſt thinke their more ſecure aboade to be in <hi>Valleyes,</hi> then on <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. All Commotion of <hi>Anger</hi> or Auerſion is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of <hi>Selfe loue</hi> remaining: The vvhich is neuer to be accounted ſubdued, till vvee be in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Indifference to all Creatures, Actions or Suffrings, as conſidered in themſelues: I ſay, <hi>as conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:</hi> For if ſuch Actions, Suffrings &amp;c, be <hi>of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> vvee are not to be in ſuch Indifference, but are to be more affected to the Obligation: for that is but to affect God, from vvhom all out Obligations doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48407:208"/> Yet if a vvorke of Obligation be agreable to our Nature, vvee muſt take heede of tying our Affections to it vnder that Notion, the vvhich vvee expreſſe by doing ſuch vvorkes vvith more then vſuall diligence, haſt &amp; impetuoſity. In ſuch caſe therfore Imperfect Soules ought to performe ſuch a vvorke as pauſingly &amp; mortifiedly, as the vvorke vvill vvell permit: And if it require haſt, let them endeauour to doe it vvith In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Reſignation &amp; indifference, at leaſt in the Superior vvill. On the contrary, if it be a vvorke from vvhich their Nature is auerted, then the more chearfully &amp; ſpeedily they performe it, the more perfectly doe they behaue themſelues: So that ſuch Speede doe not proceede from a deſire of gaining fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, or to haue it diſpatched quickly out of the vvay.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The Profeſſion of aſpiring to Perfection in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue Life requires not only Patience &amp; Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in ſuch Croſſes as vvee cannot auoide: But alſo that vvee be not Sollicitous in ſeeking to auoid them, although lavvfull meanes vvere offred: On the contrary to entertaine and make much of them, in caſe the Soule finds inward ſtrength ſufficient to entertaine them.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. A Spirituall Perſon liuing in Perfect Abſtraction may rather haue neede, and hath more leiſure to exerciſe himſelfe ſometimes in <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> imagined dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties deuiſed by himſelfe, then one that liues a diſtracted life. Such an one therfore may iudge of his impatience, either by remembring ſome iniury paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48407:208"/> or feigning one preſent, and therupon obſeruing vvhether, or hovv far <hi>Anger</hi> is ſtirred in him.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Matters about vvhich <hi>Patience</hi> is exerciſed, if they come <hi>from men,</hi> as hurts, iniuries, Perſecutions &amp;c. are generally more bitter, then thoſe that come <hi>from God,</hi> though in themſelues greater, as Sicknes, Loſſes &amp;c. Becauſe other <hi>men</hi> are but equall to vs; vvee knovv not their ſecret Intentions, but are apt to ſuſpect the vvorſt: therfore vvee take ſuch things vvorſe at their hands, then vvee vvould at <hi>Gods,</hi> vvho beſids that he is Omnipotent, and has the Supreme Dominion ouer vs, vvee knovv that his Goodnes is infinite; So that vvee can aſſure our ſelues that all his dealings tovvards vs are meant for our Good, though ſometimes vvee doe not ſee hovv they can contribute to it. And as for matters of Affliction that through imprudence or any other defect <hi>wee bring vpon our ſelues,</hi> vvee are leſſe moued to impatience by them, (though often to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret shame:) Becauſe that beſides that vvee are too apt to excuſe and fauour <hi>our ſelues,</hi> vvee are ſecure that vvee meane vvell to our ſelues.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Wee may conceiue theſe follovving <hi>Degrees</hi> to be in <hi>Patience:</hi> all vvhich muſt be aſcended before vvee can attaine to the Perfection of this vertue.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. The <hi>firſt Degree</hi> is, <hi>To haue a Serious deſire</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> and hovveuer in the Superiour vvill to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to hold Patience vpon any prouocation: And if this cannot be had at firſt, yet to procure it as ſoone as may be, at leaſt before the Sun paſſe, or in the next Recollection: And hovveuer to reſtraine the <hi>Tongue</hi>
                           <pb n="362" facs="tcp:48407:209"/> and outvvard <hi>Members</hi> from expreſſing Impatience, though perhaps as yet Anger cannot be preuented from shevving it ſelfe in ſovvre lookes. A Perſon therfore that ordinarily cannot abſtaine from deliberate <hi>angry Speeches,</hi> or vvhich is vvorſe, from paſſionate actions (in vvhich the deliberation is greater) has not as yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the lovveſt Degree of Patience.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. <hi>The ſecond is</hi> to vſe all endeauours <hi>to guard the Heart,</hi> not ſuffring the Contradiction or Croſſe to enter into it, or moue Paſſions in it: But to eſteeme the prouocations as not vvorth the conſidering, or rather as a matter from vvhich vve may reape much good.</p>

                        <p n="7">7.

                        <p n="9">9. For. 1. all thoſe that vvould maintaine the contrary opinion doe profeſſe that there is no Lavv for it.

                           <pb n="397" facs="tcp:48407:221"/>1. VVHATSOEVER the matters or occaſions are that cauſe Scrupuloſity in tender Soules, the bitterneſſe therof is felt eſpecially in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of them, or preparing themſelues to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. For then it is that all former vnſatisfactions recurre to their memory, &amp; new Examinations are made: and not only all the ſuppoſed faults, but alſo the former Examinations and Confeſſions are againe examined and Confeſſed. For to ſuch Soules, partly out of ignorance in the nature, degrees and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Sinnes, and partly hauing their mindes darkned by Feare, all Sinnes appeare to them to be Mortall, <hi>or for ought they know</hi> they may be Mortall: &amp; that ſuſpicion, or euen poſſibility is ſufficient to pierce them through vvith Greiſe and Feare.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Miſery of ſuch ſelfe afflicting Soules is much increaſed and rendred almoſt irremediable by indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete Confeſſours, vnwary Writers of Spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſuch as are vnexperienced in Internall waies: <hi>Who</hi> in the practiſe of Pennance and Confeſſion vſe the ſame Rules and meaſure towards all Soules indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, giuing Aduices in generall termes, vvhich yet are proper only for the common ſort of Soules liuing in the vvorld: <hi>who</hi> commend the repetition of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Confeſſions, preſcribing nice Rules for Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: <hi>who</hi> enioine all their Penitents in a caſe of vncertainty or Doubt, vvhether a Sin be mortall or no, to chuſe that vvhich appeares to their prepoſſeſſed iudgments <hi>the ſafer ſide,</hi> and therefore to be ſure not to omit it in Confeſſion: <hi>who</hi> recommend dayly and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48407:222"/> almoſt hovverly Examinations of Conſcience: <hi>who</hi> extoll the vertue and Efficacy of Sacraments, vvithout ſufficient regard to the Diſpoſitions, and therefore indifferently encourage Soules to frequent Confeſſions, yea euen vvhen they can find no preſent matter: in ſuch a caſe aduiſing them to repeate the mentioning of any one or more ſins formerly confeſſed, merely to continue a cuſtome of confeſſing, and to gaine a nevv acceſſe of Grace by vertue of the Keyes &amp;c. Novv ſuch Aduices and Inſtructions as theſe may poſſibly be good for ſome negligent ſoules liuing extrouerted liues (if that a proportionable care vvere alſo taken that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents should bring due Diſpoſitions to the Sacraments, vvithout vvhich the effects vvrought by them vvill be far from their expectation:) But that vvhich is a cure for ordinary ſoules, may and frequently doth proue poyſon to ſuch tender Scrupulous perſons, as vvvee novv treate of.</p>

Therfore ſurely <hi>a Confeſsour</hi> or Directour that has any taſt of Internall vvaies, and any Spirituall prudence and Charity, vvhen he is to treat vvith ſoules that he ſees haue truly a feare of God, and a ſenſible horrour of offending him, euen in a proportion beyond vvhat Charity and due confidence doe require; and that, vvere it not that they are deiected by too great an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their guilt, vvould make great progreſſe in the Diuine Loue: Perceiuing likevviſe (after ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience &amp; inſight into their liues, Exerciſes and manners of their Confeſſions) that ſuch ſoules <hi>accuſe &amp; iudge</hi> themſelues &amp; their Actions, not by any light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48407:222"/> or Knovvledge in the true Nature &amp; Degrees of ſins, but only <hi>by their ovwne Paſsion of Feare,</hi> vvhich cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts their Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp;c: <hi>Such Confeſſours,</hi> I ſay, in theſe &amp; the like circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances vvill not ſurely thinke it fit to deale vvith theſe, as vvith the ordinary ſort of <hi>tepide</hi> or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent Soules in the vvorld, that haue neede to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed, to haue their conſciences narrovvly ſearched into, to be frequently brought before the ſpirituall Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall.

                        <p n="4">4. Therfore ſurely theſe timorous &amp; tender Soules are to be told, <hi>First</hi> that the End of their coming into Religion, or of conſecrating themſelues to God in a life of Contemplation, vvas not to eni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48407:223"/> vvhat ſins are to be confeſſed, and in vvhat man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 4. <hi>That</hi> ſince it is euident that Confeſſion is their cheifeſt torment, cauſing effects in them ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to vvhat <hi>our Lord</hi> intended: that therfore they should either abſtaine vvholly from ſo frequent a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of confeſſing, or to make their confeſſions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the forme that should be preſcribed them. 5. <hi>That ſuch examinations</hi> of ſins vvill abundantly ſerue their turne, as they vvould thinke fit to be vſed in any ordinary matter of importance, and as may be made in a very short ſpace. 6. <hi>That oft it is far</hi> more prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them to exerciſe rather <hi>Vertuall Acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> and ſorrovv for ſin, by conuerting themſelues directly to God vvith Acts of <hi>Loue,</hi> then by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vvith Paſſion vpon their ſins. 7. <hi>That thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maximes.</hi> (viz. <hi>That it is the ſigne</hi> of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience there to feare a fault vvhere none is: <hi>And that nothing</hi> is to be done againſt conſcience: <hi>Likewiſe that in Doubtfull</hi> caſes the ſecureſt ſide is to be choſen &amp;c. Theſe <hi>Maximes</hi> I ſay) though in groſſe true; yet if they should be ſtrictly applied to Scrupulous perſons, vvould vtterly ruine the peace of their minds, For they are altogether incapable of iudging vvhat is againſt conſcience, or vvhat may be ſayd to be <hi>Doubtfull,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting euery thing that they feare (vvithout being able to giue any tolerable reaſon of their feare) to be <hi>against conſcience,</hi> and to be <hi>Doubtfull:</hi> It is therfore the ſpirituall Directour or experienced <hi>Confeſſour</hi> only that is to be <hi>iudge</hi> of theſe things; vvho has no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at all in the buſines, but the good of his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

                        <p n="5">5. There is no poſſible vvay to be ridde from ſcruples (beſides the hauing immediate recourſe to God by humble reſigned Prayer) but an entire indiſpenſable obedience to prudent Confeſſours, proceeding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe or the like grounds and inſtructions: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to vvhich if ſuch tender ſoules take the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to practiſe notvvithſtanding any feares in ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Nature, they vvill find their feares to decreaſe. Wheras if they neglect, or obſtinatly refuſe to put them in practiſe, their feares vvill not only grow far more dangerous, but they vvill become inexcuſable before Almighty God, and contract the heynous ſin of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, ingratitude, and vvillfull obſtinacy &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt the light vvhich God has giuen them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But vvithall they muſt knovv, that they vvill neuer haue ſufficient ſtrength and Grace to obey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paſſion, except they ſeriouſly practiſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Prayer: the vvhich alone vvill make their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to become by cuſtome far more eaſy, and alſo freed from that horrour vvhich at the firſt they will feele in ſenſitiue Nature.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Neither ought they to ſuſpect that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours ſet ouer them by God for their good, doe not vnderſtand their caſe aright. True it is, they doe not feele the paines they ſuffer, no more then Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Phyſitions doe their Patients: But yet they
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48407:224"/> knovv the cauſes of it far better then themſelues, proceeding by a Supernaturall light, not clowded by Paſſion. And vvhy should they pretend to knovv the cauſes, being ignorant of them? What intereſt is likely to corrupt their iudgment? Would they for no reward or gaine incurre the diſpleaſure of God?</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Notwithſtanding ſo ſubtile ſuch ſoules are to their owne preiudice, that though they should yeild that their Confeſſour knevv their paſt ſtate, yet they ſee ſome nevv Circumſtance vvhich vvas either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or they doubt ſo, the vvhich may perhaps alter the vvhole Caſe. As likewiſe euery nevv ſin or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect has ſomevvhat in it, to their ſeeming, different from the former, by vvhich they make a shift to ſcape from Obedience. Yet they muſt knovv that not all theſe shifts vvill excuſe them before God.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Yea they ought to conſider, that though indeed it vvere true that the Confeſſour should happen to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: Notvvithſtanding the Penitent practiſing <hi>bona fide</hi> according to his Orders in a point of this Nature about Confeſſion (vvhich is not a Morall Precept) should commit no ſin, nor incurre the leaſt danger by it: yea being an <hi>Act of Obedience</hi> for Gods ſake and in oppoſition to Naturall Paſſion, it should be an occaſion of merit to them. So that though the ſins ſuſpected by them vvere indeed <hi>Mortall,</hi> yet he iudging othervviſe, they vvould not be obliged to confeſſe them.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. But it is vvonderfull to ſee in ſoules very diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of themſelues in all other matters, ſuch an obſtinate ſelfe-iudgment in this, that they vvill neuer be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48407:224"/> that they are <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> though their vvitts be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perished by <hi>Scrupuloſity.</hi> For if this vvere once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, plaine reaſon vvould conuince them that they ought not to be their ovvne Iudges. As likevviſe in ſoules othervviſe very innocent, humble and moſt pliable to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the pertinacious diſobedience in this point of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from confeſſing or renewing Confeſſions of things forbidden them to be confeſſed is very ſtrange: So that againſt the command of their preſent Confeſſour, and the Aduice of all the moſt <hi>learned Doctours,</hi> they vvill perſiſt in their reluctance: And if their Confeſſour vvill not admit them, they vvill forbeare no meanes to find out others, though vvholly vnacquainted vvith their ſtate, to heare their Scrupuloſities. And vvhat other ground can there be of ſuch diſorder, but only ſelfe-loue deeply rooted in corrupt Nature: and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſuggeſtion of the Deuill, to vvhich ſuch ſoules by reaſon of their diſordered Imaginations and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are miſerably expoſed? They had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their vertues for faults (as their hauing reſiſted their feares in compliance vvith Obedience) then their really greateſt fault, vvhich is ſelfe Iudgment and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. A Scrupulous fearfull Soule hauing bene comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to forbeare Examination and confeſſion of ſuch particulars as doe cauſe vnquietnes in her; vvhen she comes to put this in practiſe, <hi>a double Feare</hi> vvill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe to her: <hi>the one</hi> of diſobeying her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour: and <hi>the other</hi> of going againſt her naturall Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvhich is contrary to her Confeſſours. But she
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48407:225"/> ought to conſider, that <hi>the former</hi> Feare has nothing of nature in it: yea that it contradicts Nature in its moſt ſenſible part, and therfore is far more vvorthy to take place. As for <hi>the Feare</hi> of going againſt her ovvne Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it proceeds vvholly and only from Nature, ſelfe-loue, and a deſire to be ridd of her preſent paine that the memory of her faults cauſes in her, or the Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Deuill vrging her to diſobedience: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if she cannot expell this Feare out of ſenſitiue Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, she muſt accept it as a paine, but vvithall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it as a Tentation.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. She ought to aſſure herſelfe that <hi>more harme</hi> comes to her, and incomparably greater impediments in her Exerciſe of Prayer &amp;c. by indiſcreete <hi>Confeſsions,</hi> or <hi>Examinations made merely to ſatisfy Scrupuloſity,</hi> then by all the <hi>Defects</hi> that she vvould Confeſſe: the which being generally incurred out of frailty, doe far leſſe eſtrange her from God, then ſuch Confeſſions doe; by vvhich she is habituated in ſelfe-vvill, ſelfe-iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <hi>Seruile Feare:</hi> All vvhich are the more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous, in as much as they haue a pretence of Duty, to God, and to the Orders of his Church, as alſo of humility, and a deſire to receiue benefit by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Common Reaſon vvill dictate, that it is moſt vnfitt that any one should be iudge of his ovvne ſtate, iuſt at a time vvhen a Tentation or violent Feare is actually predominant, the vvhich doe put the ſoule in a ſtrange confuſion and darknes. What a folly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp; preſumption vvould it be for a vvoman igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,

                        <p n="16">16. Such Soules are not to eſteeme, that <hi>a Feare</hi> or ſuſpicion that any thing is a ſin or Mortall, can be ſufficient to make the caſe to be <hi>Doubtfull:</hi> For <hi>a Doubt</hi> is vvhen two opinions are repreſented to the mind, and the contrary Reaſons for each are ſo euen and equall, that the Iudgment cannot determine it ſelfe to aſſent to either.

And a Scrupulous perſon cannot oftimes giue any other Reaſon or account of her Feare, but that <hi>for ought she knowes,</hi> the matter is according to her Feare.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Amongſt other ſubiects of Scruples, one is <hi>a Doubt</hi> in ſuch ſoules, <hi>whether</hi> they haue true <hi>Contrition</hi> for their faults, or no.

                        <p n="18">18.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48407:227"/> her humble Obedience vvill diſpoſe her: And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Scrupulous Fears vvill render her vtterly vnfit. Therfore Soules vvhich vvillfully nourish their Feares and Scruples by frequent vnpermitted Confeſſions haue very much to anſvver for before Almighty God for their vvillfull plunging themſelues into a State vvhich makes a Perfect vnion vvith God impoſſible, therby defeating the vvhole Deſigne of a Religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: as alſo for forſaking the vvaies of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, vvhich almoſt in all poſſible caſes are moſt full of ſecurity.</p>

To conclude this matter of Scrupuloſity: A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good vvay to Cure it is by oppoſing it in its <hi>Roote</hi> and cauſe: the which is either <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall:</hi> The ſpirituall cauſe of ſcrupuloſity is <hi>Tepidity:</hi> for though it ſeemes to be an humour full of ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, haſt and eagernes; yet the true ground oftimes of it is an vnvvillingnes and loathnes to giue God more then vvee muſt needes.

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48407:229"/> circumſtance: the vvhich <hi>Feare</hi> being <hi>Seruile,</hi> is perplexing, confounding and darkning. The proper remedy therfore is (as hath bene ſayd) an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God by Praier to correct in vs vvhat is amiſſe, &amp; to ſupply vvhat is defectiue: as alſo a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reſignation of our ſelues ſincerely and entirely to doe to our vttermoſt vvhat he requires: and vvhen all this is done, not to iudge of our ſoules eſtate, its hope or danger, ſo much by a vievv of our ovvne perfections, or a conceit of the diminishing of our imperfections, but only by our relying and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate dependance on God. For the greateſt &amp; moſt perfect ſeruants of God the more they grovv in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the more light haue they to diſcerne innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable imperfections in themſelues, vvhich cauſes great Humility, but yet does not abate their dependance &amp; confidence on God, grounded in his only Goodnes. Wheras <hi>imperfect Tepide Soules</hi> hoping to gaine ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by diminishing their imperfections (the vvhich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from Pride:) vvhen they ſee their defects rather to encreaſe, they become deiected, fearfull and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. And ſuch Scrupuloſity ariſing from Tepidity doth much encreaſe it, through a kind of deſpaire of expelling our ovvne imperfectious by our ovvne abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and neglect of the true meanes of expelling them, vvhich is <hi>Serious Prayer</hi> to God. If ſuch ſoules ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvould take this for a ground; <hi>That it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> in this life that they should euer ſee themſelues othervviſe then full of innumerable defects, of which
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48407:230"/> they are not able ſo much as to giue any account: And yet notvvithſtanding they ought, euen for that very impoſſibilities ſake, to haue recourſe vnto God &amp; to rely vpon his pardon, as alſo his helpe and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to remoue our defects, as far as his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure shall be: Againe if they vvould not expect a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or Security touching their ſtate, but be content to ſtand to Gods good pleaſure and mercy; by vvhich not only Perfection, but ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be obtained, they vvould shortly be freed from their painfull, vveariſome feares and Scrupuloſities.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Some tender Soules in Religion, that haue good minds &amp; vvills to perſeuere in ſeeking God, but being vnſatisfied vvith them ſelues becauſe they ſee ſo many Imperfections not yet amended, yea ſome that they had not obſerued before they entred into that State: They impute all their vnſuccesfullnes in curing their defects to Gods Iudgment vpon them for hauing vpon light or vaine Grounds of their ovvne Choyce vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſuch a State of life for outvvard, and perhaps vnvvorthy Ends, as to auoide vvorldly troubles, vvants; perſecutions &amp;c. and not out of a pure Intention to ſeeke God, nor from any Inſpiration from him.</p>

                           <pb n="416" facs="tcp:48407:231"/>3. But to shevv the groundleſnes of ſuch Scrupulous apprehenſions, ſuch Suſpicious Soules may doe vvell to conſider, <hi>Firſt</hi> that in theſe vvicked times in vvhich there is ſuch a decay of Charity in the vvorld, &amp; of feruour in Religion, ſuch Heroicall Enterpriſes and ſuch admirable Calls to a Religious State are not euery day to be expected, as vvee reade of in former times, vvhen <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> ſometimes euen in the prime vigour of their Age, out of a loathing of tranſitory things, and a longing after God, renounced all the abundance of vvealth, Pleaſure &amp; Glory that the vvorld could afford, in as much as they vvere impediments to their Holy deſigne of embracing Solitude, Pouerty and all other <hi>Penitentiall Auſterities</hi> in Religion. So that it is much to be doubted, that if the greateſt part of thoſe that novv enter into Religion had met vvith the like Tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; Offers in the vvorld, as <hi>thoſe</hi> deſpiſed, moſt of our Cells vvould be Empty, and our Conuents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come true Deſarts.

                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they ought to conſider, that God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pleaſed in loue to certaine Soules that perhaps vvould be in danger to make Shipvvrack of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Charity vvhich is in them, if they continued in the vvorld, to permit by an eſpeciall Prouidence cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

They had much rather haue ſtayd in the vvorld, the pleaſures of vvhich, if they could haue enioyed them, they preferred far before God. But God debarrs them from ſuch pleaſures, ſending them great Croſſes, which they can no othervviſe auoide, but by the Refuge of a Religious State. In vvhich alſo, it may be, their
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48407:232"/> firſt deſigne is to ſeeke themſelues only and not God. Yea vvee reade of one that adioyned himſelfe to a Religious Community merely for this vvicked End, to get an opportunity to commit Sacriledge by ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Chalice.

                        <p n="6">6.

                        <p n="8">8. Novv among all theſe varieties of Caſes &amp; Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Religion, shall vvee ſay that only thoſe Perfect Soules mentioned in the beginning haue a true Call to Religion?

Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vvere not perfect in Charity before they entred into Religion? (For a perfectly Pure Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot proceede but from a perfect habituall Charity) Is it therfore ſtrange to them that nature, as long as it is aliue in them, should mixe its ovvne Intereſts euen in the moſt holy Actions?

If there vvere any vndue or vnlavvfull Externall Motiues that induced them in the beginning to betake themſelues to ſuch a ſtate; Since it novv pleaſes God to shevv vnto them that ſuch a ſtate is ſo ſecure and ſo happy a Condition for their ſoules, ſurely they ought rather to employ their Tongues and thoughts to bleſſe him, vvho dealt vvith them mercifully and graciouſly beyond their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, rather then to trouble and diſquiet themſelues.

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48407:233"/> their vvills? Or that by his ſpeciall moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prouidence he diſcouraged them from abiding in the Tentations &amp; Snares of the vvorld? Or that he tooke aduantage from their Imperfections to bring them into the vvay of Petfection?

                        <p n="9">9. They ought therfore to conſider that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State they novv are, nothing can ſo much harme them as ſuch vnreaſonable and vnquiet apprehenſions. If they vvere novv in a Capacity to begin to make a free Choice, they vvould vvith an vndoubted good and right Intention renounce the vvorld; hauing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times freely confirmed their firſt Profeſſion. And ſurely this ought to ſatisfy them: For God lookes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all his ſeruants according as their preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is: ſo that if they novv ſeeke him in truth, vvhatſoeuer the Motiues vvere that brought them to their preſent ſtate, they shall be no preiudice to them: If they vvere Impure, they are forgiuen, and shall neuer be conſidered: If good, they shall be conſidered for their good only. If they ſtill haue imperfections; it is no vvonder: Who does not complaine, and iuſtly of Imperfections? When they are more perfect they vvill haue leſſer defects, but they vvill ſee many more, and be more humbled, though leſſe diſquieted for them. Hovveuer, certaine it is that Scrupuloſity &amp; Feare is their far greateſt and moſt harmfull imperfection; for this alone vvill make Perfection in the Diuine vnion impoſſible to be obtained, as long as the ſoule acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

And the vvay to cure it is not to diſpute or conteſt vvith the cauſe of it: but to neglect, tranſcend &amp; vvorke quite contrary to it; And doing ſo, though the paine continue in ſenſitiue nature, yet ſuch paine vvill proue a very purifying Mortification.</p>

                        <p n="16">16.

                        </p>
                        <p n="21">21. And vvhen Prayer is come to Perfection, then vvill the ſoule alſo mount to the <hi>ſupreme degree of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which regards God conſidered abſolutely in himſelfe,</hi> &amp; vvithout any expreſſe or diſtinct compariſon vvith creatures; for herby a ſoule fixing her ſight vpon God as <hi>all in all,</hi> &amp; contemplating him in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of incomprehenſibility, does not by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Act or reflexion conſider <hi>the vacuity &amp; nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of creatures:</hi> but really tranſcends &amp; forgets them, ſo that to her they are in very deed as nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not the obiect vvhich with her ſpirit

                        <p n="22">22. This moſt <hi>Heroycall Humility</hi> can only be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Act of Contemplation: for then only it is that a ſoule <hi>feeles her owne nothing,</hi> vvithout intending to reflect vpon it. At all other times she in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree feeles the falſe ſuppoſed being of herſelfe &amp; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                        <p n="23">23. Notvvithſtanding a great meaſure &amp; proportion of the vertue of ſuch prayer remaines, &amp; is operatiue alſo aftervvards out of prayer: for if the ſoule doe ſee creatures, she neuer ſees them as in themſelues, but only in relation to God; &amp; ſo in them humbles herſelfe to God, &amp; loues God in them. And if she reflect vpon herſelfe &amp; turne her eyes invvard into her ſpirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to find God there; there vvill not be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable imperfection, obſcurity or ſtaine that will darken her view of God, but she will diſcouer it, and moſt perfectly hate it.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. As for ſins or imperfections in others, though neuer ſo heynous, they are no hindrance to her ſeeing of God; becauſe either she tranſcends &amp; marks them not; or is by their meanes vrged to a nearer &amp; more feruent loue of <hi>him</hi> for his patience; to a greater Zeale for his honour impaired by the ſins of men; &amp; to a greater compaſſion towards ſinners.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. But <hi>the leaſt imperfection in herſelfe</hi> being real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a hindrance to her immediate vnion vvith God &amp; perfect ſight of him, is in ſo great a light as she then
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48407:240"/> enioyes, perfectly ſeene &amp; perfectly abhorred by her. Yea ſuch faults as to her naturall vnderſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly appeared no bigger then <hi>moates,</hi> doo in vertue of this ſupernaturall light ſeeme as <hi>mountaines;</hi> And defects which she before neuer dreamed or imagined to be in herſelfe, she now ſees not only to be, but to abound &amp; beare great ſway in her. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſaith <hi>S. Gregory</hi> (l. 22. Moral. c. 1.) <hi>Sancti Viri quo altiùs apud Deum proficiunt, eò ſubtiliùs indignos ſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendunt; quia dum proximi luci fiunt, quidquid in illis latebat inueniunt.</hi> That is, <hi>Holy men the higher that they raiſe themſelues approaching to God; the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe they perceiue their owne vnworthines. Becauſe being incompaſſed with a purer light, they diſcouer in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thoſe defects which before they could not ſee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="26">26. Hence it appeares that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene <hi>the knowledge of our owne Nothing,</hi> &amp; the <hi>feeling or perception of it. The former</hi> may be got by a little meditation, or by reading of <hi>Schoole Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> vvhich teaches &amp; demonſtrates, how that <hi>of our ſelues wee are nothing, but mere dependences on the only true Being of God.</hi> Wheras <hi>the Feeling of our owne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> vvill neuer be attained by ſtudy or meditation alone, but by the raiſing &amp; purifying of our ſoules by Prayer. The <hi>Deuill</hi> hath the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of creatures in a far greater perfection then any man, &amp; yet he hath nothing at all of the <hi>feeling.</hi> Novv it is only the <hi>feeling of our not-being that is true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Humility:</hi> as on the contrary, <hi>the feeling of our being</hi> is Pride.</p>

                           <pb n="436" facs="tcp:48407:241"/>27. Novv <hi>this Feeling</hi> of our <hi>not-being</hi> has <hi>two degrees.</hi> 1. <hi>The firſt</hi> is <hi>in regard of the corporall or ſenſitiue faculties:</hi> to vvit, vvhen the ſoule is ſo raiſed aboue the body &amp; all deſires concerning it, that it hath loſt all care &amp; ſollicitude about it, hauing mortified in a great meaſure all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Paſſions. This is a high degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> but not yet perfect as may appeare plainly by this, That after a ſoule hath attained herto by <hi>a Paſsiue Vnion,</hi> there ordinarily follovves the great <hi>Priuation</hi> or deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in vvhich she finds herſelfe to be yet full of her ſelfe &amp; her ovvne being, combatted vvith may riſings &amp; repugnances. 2. <hi>The ſecond degree</hi> follovves after that the ſaid <hi>Priuation</hi> ceaſes, in vvhich the ſoule exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes herſelfe after a far more ſublime manner, &amp; begins then to haue a more perfect feeling of her not-being conſiſting in an Abſtraction from the ſoule herſelfe &amp; all her faculties &amp; operations, all vvhich are ſo loſt &amp; annihilated in God, that in her exerciſes of moſt pure Prayer, she cannot perceyue diſtinctly any vvorking either in the vnderſtanding or Will, not being able to vnderſtand or giue an account of vvhat she does vvhen she Prayes.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. The <hi>Authour of Secrets ſentiers</hi> ſaith, that ſoules vvhich are arriued to this ſtate of perfect vnion are yet ordinarily permitted by God to deſcend oft from their high Abſtractions into their inferiour nature, euen as they vvere during their ſtate of entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſpirituall courſe.

                        <p n="29">29. But alas, theſe <hi>Contemplations,</hi> &amp; conſequently the ſaid bleſſed fruites of them, are very rare; &amp; not at all in our ovvne povver to come to at pleaſure; in as much as a ſoule does not arriue to the perfection of Prayer till after a Paſſiue vnion or Contemplation, vvherto vvell may vvee diſpoſe our ſelues according to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver; but it is in the free vvill &amp; pleaſure of God to conferre it on vvhom, vvhen &amp; in vvhat manner it pleaſeth him.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. But hovveuer let not <hi>Beginners</hi> nor <hi>Proficients</hi> in ſpirituality be diſcouraged for that as yet they cannot find in themſelues (or at leaſt very imperfectly) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of their not-being, not hauing as yet a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Intellectuall ſpecies euidently &amp; euen palpably repreſenting to their minds <hi>Gods Totality</hi> &amp; <hi>their owne Nothing;</hi> the vvhich ſpecies it is not the nature of <hi>Actiue</hi> exerciſes to produce.

                           <p>§. 1. Wee doe not here treate of all kinds of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Vertues; but principally ſuch as are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; most neceſſary to be known &amp; practiſed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to an Internall life.</p>
                           <p>§. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c. Seuerall Aduices and obſeruations touching Vertues in generall.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. HITHERTO vvee haue treated of the <hi>firſt Inſtrument</hi> and meane of <hi>Perfection,</hi> to vvit, <hi>Mortification;</hi> at leaſt ſo far as vvee conceiued proper to the deſigne of this booke, that is, in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Prayer of Contemplation. And therfore it is that vvee haue not inlarged the diſcourſe to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vniuerſally all Morall vertues (the vvhich are Mortifications to all our diſtempered affections) but only ſuch as are more peculiar to Religious or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall liuers. For the reſt, the <hi>Reader</hi> is referred to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes of <hi>Chriſtian Morality,</hi> vvhich abundantly treate of that ſubiect. The doctrine of vvhich may be applied to the preſent purpoſe, if Reflexion be made on the Aduices vvhich haue already bene giuen concerning the ſpeciall vertues hitherto treated of. To the vvhich I vvill, for concluſion of this Treatiſe, adde a fevv more touching <hi>Vertues in generall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The firſt aduice</hi> is this; That before a ſoule can attaine to perfect Contemplation, it is neceſſary that she be adorned vvith all ſorts of Chriſtian vertues, not
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48407:251"/> one excepted, according to the ſaying of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Ibunt de virtute in virtutem: videbit ur Deus Deorum in Sion.</hi> That is, <hi>They shall goe from one vertue to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And then</hi> (&amp; not till then) <hi>the God of Gods shall be contemplated in Sion.</hi> So that if a ſoule make a ſtop at any vertue, of vvillingly fauour herſelfe in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affection, it vvill not be poſſible for her to aſcend to the top of the mountaine vvhere God is ſeene.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The Second</hi> regards <hi>the manner</hi> of attaining to vertues: For vvee are not ſo to vnderſtand theſe words of the Pſalmiſt, as if a ſoules progreſſe to Perfection vvas by a ſucceſſiue gaining of one vertue after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for example, firſt poſſeſſing herſelfe of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Temperance,</hi> &amp; hauing got that, then procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Patience, Humility, Chaſtity</hi> &amp;c. But they are all in the <hi>roote</hi> gotten together, &amp; vvee make no progreſſe in one Vertue, but vvithall vvee make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable progreſſe in all the reſt. And <hi>the reaſon</hi> is, becauſe <hi>Charity</hi> is the roote of all Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, they being only ſuch duties as Charity (vvhich alone directs vs to God, our laſt end) vvould &amp; doth dictate to be practiſed on ſeuerall &amp; different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. True it is, that either by our naturall tempers, or by hauing more frequent tryalls &amp; occaſions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing ſome vertues, certaine Paſſions oppoſite to them may be, according to the materiall diſpoſition in corporall nature, more ſubdued &amp; regulated, then others: yet in regard of the diſpoſition of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48407:251"/> ſoule (that is the iudgment of the mind &amp; reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the vvill) the ſoule (according to the merit of the obiect) is <hi>equally</hi> (by an equality of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) inclined to all good, and equally auerted from all ill. Becauſe diuine Loue is equally inconſiſtent with all mortall ſins, and doth combat &amp; ſubdue ſelfe-loue in all its branches. Our progreſſe therfore expreſſed in the Phraſe <hi>[de virtute in virtutem]</hi> is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be from a lower &amp; more imperfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Charity, and all its vertues, to a higher; till vvee come to the mount of Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>The Third Aduice</hi> is, that this progreſſe &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in vertues is neither equall at all times; for the ſoule by reſiſting ſtronger temptations, &amp; in vertue of more efficacious Prayer doth make greater ſtrides and paces; Neither is it alvvaies obſeruable either by the Traueller himſelfe or others. Yea it is <hi>neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary, nor (perhaps) conuenient</hi> that vvee should much heede the <hi>Rules</hi> that are giuen by ſome for examination of our <hi>Proficiency.</hi> Such enquiry ſeemes not very ſuitable to humility &amp; probably vvill not produce any good effect in vs; It may ſuffiſe vs that vvee goe on, and that God knovves perfectly our grovvth in Piety &amp; loue, &amp; vvill moſt aſſuredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard vs proportionally, though vvee should be neuer ſo ignorant to vvhat degree of Perfection vvee are arriued.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All increaſe of ſanctifying Grace by vvhatſoeuer inſtruments it be produced, as by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Auſterities, Temperance, <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
                           <pb n="458" facs="tcp:48407:252"/>  is performed according to the good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diſpoſitions and Actuations of ſoule accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the vſe of them. Yea the ſame may alſo in a certaine proportion be affirmed euen of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> themſelues <hi>(in adultis:)</hi> The vvhich although by their ovvne intrinſecall Vertue and (as the <hi>Councell of Trent.</hi> ſeſſ. 7. can. 8. expreſſes it) <hi>ex opere operato</hi> they doe <hi>conſerre</hi> a peculiar <hi>Grace</hi> and ayde: and this, <hi>Quantum eſt parte Dei, at all times, and on all Perſons that duly receiue</hi> them. (ſee ſeſſ. 7. cap. 6. &amp; 7.) Yet vvithall the quantity and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the ſayd <hi>Grace</hi> is in the ſame <hi>Councell</hi> (ſeſſ. 6. cap. 7.) ſayd to be <hi>(Secundam propriam cuiuſque diſpoſitionem &amp; cooperationem) according to the peculiar diſpoſition and cooperation of each Perſon reſpectiuely:</hi> That is, Thoſe that come vvith more (or leſſe) perfect, intenſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and multiplied <hi>Internall Acts</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity, Deuotion</hi> &amp;c, doe accordingly receiue a more (or leſſe) plentifull meaſure of Sacramentall Grace. Novv vvhat are all theſe diſpoſitions and <hi>Preparations</hi> but the Exerciſing of <hi>Internall Prayer?</hi> Whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares hovv vvonderfull an Influence <hi>Internall Prayer</hi> both by vvay of <hi>Merit</hi> or impetration, and likevviſe by <hi>a direct Efficiency</hi> hath in the producing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>Diuine vertues</hi> in the Soule.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> if a ſoule out of the times of <hi>Prayer</hi> shall in occaſions (for example) of contradictions, perſecutions &amp;c: neglect to exerciſe Patience, she muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe impatience; &amp; by conſequence vvill make little or no progreſſe by her Prayer; Yet if then she
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:48407:252"/> shall vſe any reaſonable care, diligence or vvatchfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ouer herſelfe, though not for the getting of much, yet not to looſe much out of Prayer, God vvill by meanes of her Prayer ſeriouſly proſecuted, infuſe ſuch a meaſure of Grace as vvill cauſe a progreſſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſtanding frequent failings through frailty or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduertence &amp;c. But it vvill be late ere the effects of ſuch infuſion vvill appeare.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> increaſe in vertue doth purely depend on the free Grace &amp; good pleaſure of God, conferring the ſaid grace in prayer &amp;c. in a meaſure as himſelfe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, &amp; alſo by his holy Prouidence adminiſtring occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſeuerally of exerciſing ſeuerall vertues; The vvhich occaſions ordinarily are not at all in our ovvne povver or diſpoſall.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Seauenthly,</hi> according to our progreſſe in vertues, ſo is our progreſſe in Prayer; &amp; till the ſoule be in a very high degree purified from ſelfe-loue, she is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of that perfect degree of Prayer, vvhich is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Contemplation;</hi> According to that ſaving of <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, (Math.</hi> 5.) <hi>Beati mundo, corde, quoniam ipſi Deum, videbunt:</hi> That is, <hi>Bleſsed are the Pure in heart, for they shall ſee God.</hi> And the reaſon is euident, <hi>becauſe</hi> vntill the internall Eye of the ſoule be cleanſed from the miſts of Paſſions &amp; inordinate Affections, it neither vvill nor can fixe it ſelfe vpon ſo pure &amp; diuine an obiect. True it is that in euery the moſt imperfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Prayer</hi> (by vvhich the ſoule is proportionally purified) God is, in ſome qualified ſence contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But vvee doe not apply the terme of <hi>Contemplation,</hi>
                           <pb n="460" facs="tcp:48407:253"/> except only to the moſt ſublime degree of prayer. The vvhich yet is neuer ſo perfectly abſolute in this life but that it may vvithout limitation increaſe: Becauſe the ſoule is neuer ſo perfectly freed from the bitter fruits of <hi>originall ſin (Ignorance</hi> &amp; <hi>Concupiſcence</hi>) but there vvill ouer remaine matter &amp; exerciſe for further mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or purification.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Vertues are in no other ſtate of life ſo perfectly eſtablished in the depth &amp; center of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as in <hi>a Contemplatiue state;</hi> Becauſe all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes therof doe principally &amp; directly regard the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſpiritualiſing &amp; purification of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by a continuall application, adheſion &amp; vnion of it to God, the fountaine of light &amp; Purity.</p>

For by Prayer alone exerciſed in Solitude he can employ and engage Gods Omnipotence, Wiſedome and all the treaſures of his riches for the ſupplying all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, Externall and Internall of his Church.

For to ſoules that liued (as anciently they did) entirely ſequeſtred from all vvordly buſines or conuerſation, in Continuall laborious &amp; penitentiall Exerciſes, hauing no Images of creatures to diſtract their minds, and much leſſe any inordinate Affections to creatures to depreſſe them from mounting to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vnion vvith God, it vvas more then ſufficient for ſuch to knovv that their duty &amp; the end of their ſolitude vvas to liue in a continuall conuerſation vvith God, ſuffring themſelues to be conducted and managed by his holy Spirit.

Wee ſee many, which often times in the yeare doe aproach to the Sacrament of pennance, &amp; as far as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fraylty &amp; infirmity will permit, doe with ſufficient diligence endeauour to purge away all the ſtaines &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenes of ſin; And yet they make no progreſse, but are ſtill the very ſame that they were.

Now the only cauſe of all theſe diſorders is,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48407:266"/> that they doe not ſeriouſly enter into their owne hearts by Exerciſes of Introuerſion, but only esteeme &amp; regard the exteriour</hi> &amp;c: Thus far are the vvords &amp; too iuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the learned &amp; pious Cardinall.</p>

Therfore Vocall Prayer is only that Prayer which may want attention: namely when the thoughts diuerting themſelues to other obiects, the tongue without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the mind giues an vncertaine ſound.</hi> And vvee may adde, <hi>That</hi> the attention of the mind vvhich cannot be ſeparated from Diſcourſiue Prayer, is little valuable, except it be accompanied vvith, or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in order to the cauſing an <hi>attention</hi> (as vvee may call it) <hi>of the heart,</hi> or affections.</p>

But the trueth lyes betwene theſe two extremes; for moſt manifeſt it is that vvee are obliged to aſpire vnto vninterrupted Prayer; And yet moſt certaine alſo it is, that beſides ſimple Prayer there are many other Duties required of vs. The ſence therfore and importance of our Lords precept of <hi>Praying continually without failing,</hi> may be cleared by tvvo paſſages of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> The firſt is this (1. Tim. 4.) <hi>Cibos creauit Deus ad percipiendum</hi> &amp;c. That is. <hi>God hath created meates to be receiued with giuing of thanks by his faithfull ſeruants, &amp; thoſe which haue knowne the trueth. For euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is good, &amp; nothing to be reiected which is receiued with giuing of thanks; for it is ſanctified by the word of God &amp; by Prayer.</hi> The ſecond is (1. Cor. 10.) <hi>Siue ergo manducatis ſiue &amp;c.</hi> That is; <hi>Therfore whether
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48407:271"/> you eate or drinke, or what other thing ſoeuer you doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> From vvhich <hi>Texts</hi> it appeares. 1. <hi>That all</hi> creatures are in their vſe vnſanctified vnto vs, that is prophane, vnleſſe they be vſed vvith Prayer. 2. <hi>That wee</hi> are obliged not only in the vſe of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by eating &amp; drinking &amp;c: but alſo in all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions vvhatſoeuer to ioyne Prayer &amp; a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating of them to Gods glory; ſo that if vvee comply vvith theſe our obligations &amp; duties, vvee muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually either be in actuall Prayer, or buſyed in ſomthing done in vertue of Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Novv as vvee ſaid in the <hi>first Treatiſe,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>all are not obliged</hi> neceſſarily <hi>to attaine</hi> vnto the <hi>perfection</hi> proportionable to each ones ſtate; yet all are neceſſarily bound <hi>to aſpire thereunto; Becauſe</hi> no man can loue God vvith a ſincere loue, &amp; ſuch an one as may be accounted vvorthy of <hi>Him</hi> vvho is <hi>our only Good</hi> &amp; beatitude, that shall fixe any limits to his loue, or that shall not aſpire continually to a further &amp; higher degree of his loue. So here likevviſe, vvee are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that this Precept of praying continually ſo inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely expreſſed, ſo earneſtly preſſed, ſo vniuerſally applied, both by our Lord, &amp; his Apoſtle, to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, doth inferre an indefinite &amp; vniuerſall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as that although none but the <hi>Perfect</hi> doe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fullfill it, yet all, euen the moſt imperfect, cannot vvithout danger diſpence vvith or neglect the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring &amp; aſpiring to the fullfilling of it. Euery one muſt exerciſe as much Prayer as shall be neceſſary to ſanctify his vocation, &amp; make the vvorkes &amp; Duties
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48407:271"/> of his life acceptable to God, &amp; helpfull to the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his eternall felicity.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And the ground of this obligation is both very firme &amp; manifeſt: vvhich is this, <hi>That</hi> euen reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, that all the things vvee doe, vvee ought to doe them in order to <hi>our laſt end,</hi> vvhich is <hi>God:</hi> that is, vvith a ſanctified Intention (for vvhatſoeuer is not done vvith a right Intention in order to God is of no vvorth at all, being only a vvorke of corrupt nature:) Novv ſince there are only tvvo things vvhich doe ſanctify all things &amp; actions, to vvit, <hi>the word of God &amp; Prayer;</hi> the <hi>word of God generally,</hi> that is the certaine &amp; reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vvill of God, that the thing is in it ſelfe lavvfull to be vſed or done: &amp; <hi>Prayer in particular,</hi> proceeding from faith or aſſurance that the thing is lavvfull, &amp; therupon acknovvleging it to be Gods gift, deſiring his bleſſing on it, &amp; referring it to his glory  Hence it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follovves, that ſince vvithout Prayer all things are vnſanctified, or prophane, not at all conducing to our laſt end, but rather preiudiciall to it, therfore all are bound to endeauour to ſanctify all their actions &amp; vvorkes by Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Hence vvee may inferre, that the <hi>Degrees of Grace</hi> &amp; ſanctity in any man are to be meaſured according to the vertue that prayer has vpon his Actions; for the more, &amp; more frequently that his ordinary Actions are performed in vertue of prayer, the more perfect &amp; holy ſuch an one is, &amp; the more approaching to his cheife end; And he vvhoſe Actions doe not for the moſt part flovv from the vertue of Prayer, is not yet right diſpoſed tovvards his laſt end.</p>

                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48407:272"/>9.

                        <p n="1">1. AS 1.

                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48407:285"/>2. I doe not therfore here vnder the terme of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions</hi> comprehend all manner of interruptions from a direct actuall tendance to God; (for ſuch ſometimes, conſidering the Infirmity of our nature, may be neceſſary, to the end that by a diſcreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation the head being refreshed, vvee may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled aftervvards to produce more efficacious Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And therfore thoſe <hi>Authours</hi> are too indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly rigorous vvho oblige ſoules, not yet perfect, to a continuall recollected Attention to the Diuine preſence, not conſidering the corporall infirmity &amp; incapacity of their diſciples ſpirits, eſpecially in theſe dayes.)

                        <p n="3">3. Novv it is an effect of <hi>Originall ſin</hi> (much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo by <hi>Actuall</hi>) that ſoules are generally, ſome more ſome leſſe, ſubiect to this deordination: Becauſe by ſin that due ſubordination of the ſenſitiue facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (the <hi>Imagination;</hi> memory &amp; appetite) to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſoule, is empaired, ſo that the reaſon has not that abſolute Dominion ouer them that it had in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;</hi> But they often vvander tovvards obiects not preſcribed by reaſon, yea &amp; ſometimes ſeduce &amp; euen compell reaſon it ſelfe to comply vvith their diſorders.

                        <p n="5">5. For as for <hi>thoughts</hi> merely about <hi>vaine</hi> obiects, to vvhich wee haue little or no affection, &amp; vvhich proceed wholly from the <hi>inſtability of the Imagination:</hi> Imperfect ſoules ought not to be diſcouraged vvith them, although they should be neuer ſo importunate during their recollections, ſince the <hi>moſt abſtracted liuer</hi> muſt be content novv &amp; then to <hi>ſuffer them.</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Firſt</hi> therfore, it is apparent and acknovvledged that generall ſpeaking, a Soule from a ſtate of Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence &amp; ſecularity firſt entring into a ſpirituall Courſe though she be ſuppoſed by Vertue of that <hi>Grace</hi> by vvhich she is moued to make ſo great and happy a Change, to be really in the ſtate of <hi>Iustification: yet</hi> there ſtill remaines in her a great meaſure of <hi>Feare</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the guilt of her former ſins: And vvithall ſtrong inclinations to ſin and vicious habits doe yet abide, and vvill doe ſo, till by long practice of Vertue and Piety they be abated and expelled: Moreouer a vvorld of vaine and <hi>ſinfull Images</hi> doe poſſeſſe the Soule, vvhich diſtract her vvhenſoeuer she ſets her mind on God, calling her to attend to her formerly-pleaſing obiects, vvhich tooke vp all her Affections, and vvhich doe ſtill oftimes inſinuate themſelues into her Memory, vvith too much contentment to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour nature: The vvhich contentment though she v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon reflection doe reſiſt and renoune vvith her Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Soule, yet this reſiſtance is oftimes ſo feeble, that frequently she is really intangled and ſeduced, &amp; more oft does find ground to doubt that she has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen conſent therto.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Such being ordinarily the diſordered condition of a Soule at her <hi>first Conuerſion:</hi> The <hi>Remedy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledged to be proper and neceſſary for her is Prayer: And the higheſt degree of Praier that for the preſent she is capable of is either a much <hi>diſtracted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48407:301"/> Vocall Praier,</hi> or <hi>Diſcourſiue Meditation,</hi> in vvhich the Vnderſtanding and imagination are cheifly employed.

                        <p n="9">9.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48407:304"/> repreſented to the mind in them: <hi>For</hi> 1. in <hi>Meditation</hi> the ſoule, as yet much immerſed in ſenſe, is forced to make vſe of a diſtinct groſſer Image by vvhich to apprehend him, as the <hi>Humanity of our Lord</hi> and the Myſteries belonging thereto, and ſometimes ſuch <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>the Diuinity</hi> as are moſt obuious and eaſy to be conceiued, and vvhich doe produce more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible motions in our imperfect Soules, as his <hi>Iustice, Mercy, Power</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>But in the practiſe</hi> of the Acts <hi>of the will,</hi> the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> endeauours to apprehend God in the <hi>obſcure Notion of Faith:</hi> And vvhen she is ſometimes forced to make vſe of more particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Images, the mind after a short reflexion on them giues place to the recollected Actuations of the vvill alone. 3. <hi>But being</hi> arriued to <hi>Aſpirations</hi> (vvhich is <hi>Actiue Contemplatian</hi>) the Soule makes vſe of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular expreſſe <hi>Images</hi> at all, but contents herſelfe vvith the only generall obſcure Notion of God vvhich <hi>Faith</hi> teaches her.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Novv though it may ſeeme that the moſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> haue no great aduantage in this regard ouer the more <hi>imperfect:</hi> Since all that are indued vvith ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary knovvledge doe ſufficiently beleiue, and are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that <hi>God,</hi> being infinite and incomprehenſible, cannot be truly repreſented by any particular Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Notions, the vvhich are creatures of our ovvne framing: Notvvithſtanding vvee are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there is a great difference betvveene the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledging of this <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Speculatiue Iudgment,</hi> and the operating according to ſuch a <hi>Truth</hi> by <hi>the

Wheras on the contrary, Perfect Soules hauing by long practiſe purifyed their internall Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in time doe come to ſuch a State that they cannot, if they vvould, receiue benefit, or vvarme their <hi>Affections</hi> by ſenſible or particular Images: Except they doe ſilence not only the <hi>Imagination,</hi> but <hi>Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> alſo, the <hi>Will</hi> remaines vvithout motion or vigour. Yea in the particular caſe of <hi>the great Deſolation</hi> the <hi>Eleuations of the Will</hi> alſo become ſo vvonderfully pure, delicate, and euen vnperceptible, that the Soule it ſelfe can ſcarce perceiue, or ſo much as beleiue that she operates tovvards God: inſomuch as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary she is oft perplexed vvith great feare and doubt that in truth she does not loue God.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Novv the foreſaid <hi>Diuiſion</hi> of the <hi>three States of Praier,</hi> together vvith the ſucceſſiue purification and <hi>ſpiritualizing of Images</hi> is ſo grounded on reaſon and euen Nature, that euery one that experiences Prayer vvill perceiue it, and others cannot except againſt it.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48407:305"/> For as vvee ſee in all <hi>Arts and Sciences,</hi> as (for example) <hi>Muſick</hi> or Poetry, a Perſon that ſets himſelfe to learne them, is at the firſt obliged to make vſe of a vvorld of groſſe <hi>diſtinct Images,</hi> the vvhich he applyes particularly and leaſurely to euery ſtring, euery ſtop and euery finger mouing the Inſtrument: as likewiſe to euery vvord and ſyllable in a Verſe. But by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe hauing attained to a moderate skill, a far leſſe number of Images vvill ſerue to direct him. And the reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Images</hi> by practiſe becoming more <hi>pure</hi> and ſpirituall, are by conſequence more <hi>vniuerſall;</hi> ſo that one will come to haue the Vertue of a great number vvhich formerly vvere requiſite. And at laſt the Perſon becoming perfect in thoſe Arts vvill be able to make a Verſe exact according to the Rules of Poetry vvithout any perceptible reflexion vpon any particular Rules; And to play on an Inſtrument not only in the darke, but euen whilſt he is conuerſing vvith another; By reaſon that the Images are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo pure and vniuerſall, that the Perſon vſing them perceiues them not, neither knowes by what he is directed.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Novv if the <hi>Operation of a Soule</hi> in <hi>naturall,</hi> ſenſible things may come to be ſo pure and ſubtile, much more in <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>Diuine</hi> matters: in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing about vvhich her endeauours ought to be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all manner both of ſenſible and intellectuall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: or rather in exerciſing about vvhich <hi>the will alone</hi> ſtriues to be operatiue.</p>

But yet vvhen ſuch <hi>Grace</hi> and Deuotion (vvhich ordinarily laſts not long) does come to ceaſe, she vvill be forced to returne to her imperfect exerciſe of Meditation: Or if out of an auerſion from deſcending lovver, she vvill needs ſtick to thoſe higher Exerciſes (vvhich to her are but <hi>temporary</hi>) she vvill by meanes of Aridity and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion looſe all the fruit of her Recollections, vvhich vvill indeed become inſupportable to her.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. So on the other ſide it may vvell happen that a ſoule that is aſcended to the <hi>Exerciſe of immediate Acts,</hi> may ſome times for ſome short ſpace find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for her to helpe herſelfe novv and then by vſing <hi>Meditation,</hi> and ſeeking Motiues in the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to moue her Affections.

                        <p n="23">23.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE <hi>first</hi> and moſt imperfect <hi>Degree of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Prayer</hi> is (as hath been ſaid) <hi>Meditation</hi> or Diſcourſiue Prayer: Of vvhich vvee shall treate here, not vvith that exact niceneſſe as may be found in many Bookes current in all hands, yet ſufficiently in order to our preſent Deſigne, vvhich is to conſider it only as <hi>a preparation</hi> to the Perfect <hi>Prayer of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi> And therefore the Inſtructions concerning it shall be ſuch as may be proper for thoſe vvhom God hath called to that Perfect State, and vvithall moued to comply vvith the ſaid <hi>Call.</hi> And to ſuch many Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will not be proper.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Meditation</hi> is ſuch an Internall Prayer, in vvhich a Deuout Soule doth in the firſt place take in hand the conſideration of ſome particular <hi>Myſtery of Faith,</hi> to the end that by a ſerious and exact ſearch into the ſeuerall points and circumſtances in it vvith the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48407:307"/> or Imagination, she may extract Motiues of good Affections to God, and conſequently produce ſuitable Affections in vertue of the ſaid Motiues, as long as ſuch vertue vvill laſt.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This is a Prayer to the exerciſe vvhereof all ſorts of Perſons are neither diſpoſed, nor enabled. Neither is it a token either of excellency of vvit &amp; Iudgment, or of true <hi>Deuotion</hi> to be apt for the practiſe of it. On the contrary the more that a Soule doth abound vvith Deuotion and good Affections to God, the leſſe is she enabled or diſpoſed thereto, yea incapable of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing long in the Exerciſe of it. And againe, ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall Witts, full of fancy, but vvanting ſolidity of Iudgment, and vvhich are not naturally much diſpoſed to Deuotion, yet if they be put to the Exerciſe of this Diſcourſiue Prayer, they vvill performe it better, and thriue more in it, then others though of sharpe vvitts, ſolide Iudgments, and great abilities both in learning and Inuention, and that vvithall haue very good vvills to ſeeke our Lord.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Women</hi> are, generally ſpeaking, <hi>leſse apt for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then <hi>men:</hi> and by conſequence more fit for the more perfect Exerciſes of the Will: By reaſon that they are more diſabled in iudgment and inuention, and more abounding in vvill and Affections: ſo that <hi>in them the Will drawes the ſtreame from the Vnderſtanding.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great care is to be taken that they be not compelled vvithout neceſſity to tarry long in Diſcourſiue Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: leaſt thereby they be much preiudiced in the Head and Spirit, vvith little or no proffit any vvay, but much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48407:308"/> harme, in being detained from the more proper and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall Exerciſe of the Will in holy Affections.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Novv there being ſo great and inexpreſſible <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> in the <hi>Internall Diſpoſitions</hi> of perſons, it is not poſſible to giue certaine &amp; generall Rules to fit all; Except this, <hi>that in the beginning of a ſpirituall Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue Courſe all Soules that are not naturally incapable of raiſing Affections by internall Diſcourſe, ought to apply themſelues thereto, and to tarry therin till they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ripe for a future Exerciſe:</hi> To the vvhich they vvill attaine ſooner or later, either according to their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and conſtancy in practiſing Meditation; Or the meaſure and Grace of Deuotion vvhich God shall giue them; Or their naturall aptnes or vnaptnes for Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the Vnderſtanding.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. This <hi>Aduice</hi> is of great concernment: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſoules are not eaſily and lightly to be permited to apply themſelues to <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> till a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time ſpent in thoſe of the <hi>Vnderſtanding.</hi> For though perhaps vvhilſt the <hi>Feruor Nouitius</hi> laſts in the beginning of one's <hi>Conuerſion,</hi> a ſoule being then full of Affection, may for a vvhile haue little need of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues</hi> to open the paſſage to the ſaid <hi>Affections,</hi> vvhich of themſelues vvill be apt enough to flovv: Yet that <hi>Feruour</hi> ceaſing, they vvill be at a miſerable loſſe, full of nothing but <hi>Aridities, Obſcurities</hi> &amp; <hi>Deſolations,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no <hi>refuge</hi> at all, except their <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> be ſtored vvith good <hi>Motiues</hi> of holy Affections cauſed by former Conſideration and Meditation.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Yet this is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as if Soules
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48407:308"/> vvere to be obliged to thoſe nice, diſtracting painfull <hi>Methods of Meditation</hi> which are deſcribed in many Bookes: or to frame curious <hi>Pageants</hi> &amp; <hi>ſcenes</hi> of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> to be meditated on &amp;c. For though ſuch an Employment of the Imagination in Prayer may be proper &amp; proffitable for thoſe that by their Profeſſion liue <hi>Actiue,</hi> diſtracted liues: to the end by ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the <hi>Fancy</hi> to wipe out, as it vvere, the vaine Images contracted abroad, by ſuperinducing, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ouer them new and holy Images: Yet for thoſe vvho are more <hi>Solitary</hi> &amp; abſtracted, ſuch a vvay of Meditating vvould be very painfull, &amp; the proffit ſo little, as it vvould not counteruaile the paine. To ſuch therfore it vvill ſuffiſe, vvith moderate attention to thinke on the ſubſtance of the Myſtery propoſed, or on ſuch circumſtances of it as either are expreſſed in the <hi>Text,</hi> or doe euen naturally attend it, &amp; from thence to dravv as ſtrong, feruorous &amp; frequent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as may be.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. As for thoſe that are <hi>naturally vtterly disabled</hi> and incapable of <hi>Meditating</hi> (as many Women are) it is very requiſite in the beginning that they should at leaſt ſupply the benefit that comes from Meditation, by preparing themſelues to their Recollections vvith much, ſerious &amp; attentiue <hi>reading</hi> of ſome pious Booke, the vvhich may in ſome good proportion recompence Meditation.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But in caſe a ſoule incapable of Meditation and vnable likevviſe to reade, shall vndertake a ſpirituall, Contemplatiue courſe (as none are excluded:) ſuch an
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48407:309"/> one muſt reſolue to take a very great courage to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue her Exerciſes of the Will and Affections (which is but <hi>a dry Exerciſe,</hi> &amp; wanting ſenſible Deuotion, is very ingratefull to the palate of the ſoule:) She muſt be prepared not to be daunted vvith Aridities and Diſtractions: The vvhich <hi>Distractions</hi> she has no other vvay to reſiſt or expell, but only by pure <hi>Obſtinacy of the will</hi> not to attend them, or care for them: And laſtly she muſt vſe more Abſtraction of life and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to preuent the multiplying of Diſtracting Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Thoſe vvho in the Exerciſe of <hi>Meditation</hi> are more ſeriouſly affected to the <hi>Diſcourſing part</hi> of it, then to the good Deſires and purpoſes vvhich should flovv from ſuch Diſcourſe, are in danger of many perills, as of <hi>Pride, Curioſity, Extrauagant Opinions,</hi> yea <hi>pernicious Errours.</hi> The cauſe of vvhich Dangers is the <hi>predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi> that their <hi>Imagination</hi> hath ouer their other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, vvhich inclines them to pleaſe themſelues vvith ſubtile aeriall and curious Diſcourſes, and vvith fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of places, &amp; times and other circumſtances in the conſideration of a Myſtery. All vvhich inconueniences are auoided in the <hi>Exerciſes of the Superiour Will,</hi> vvhich being a <hi>blind faculty,</hi> is beſt able to heaue vp herſelfe vnto God in darknes and vacancy of Images: And being likevviſe a <hi>Spirituall</hi> faculty, is exempted from the Deuills influences, vvho has great dominion ouer our corporeall Povvers to ſuggeſt repreſentations &amp;c. For theſe reaſons it is good to make the Diſcourſing part of Meditation as short as may be: So as that if the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48407:309"/> mere reflexion on a Myſtery vvill ſuffiſe to produce a good affection, the perſon is to reſtraine the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. To conclude; the great and inexplicable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety that is to be found in the diſpoſitions of Soules being conſidered: and likewiſe the great inconuenience that neceſſarily follovvs a miſapplication of Spirits to Exerciſes improper for them, the ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe good Soules cannot ſufficiently be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayled, vvho by their Profeſſion being as it vvere empriſoned in a Solitary, Religious Life, and being naturally vnapt for Diſcourſe, are yet kepd all their liues in Meditation, repeating ouer and ouer againe the ſame <hi>toyleſome Methods,</hi> vvithout any progreſſe in Spirit, to their great anguish and diſquietnes. And this miſery is much greater in Religious Women, vvho hauing no diuerſions of Studies or employments, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly find exerciſe for their Imagination: and therfore ſeeing great Defects and vnſatisfactions in themſelues, and not knovving the only cure of them, (vvhich is by aſcending to the Internall Exerciſes of the vvill) their Imperfections increaſe, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes proportionably, vvithout any knovvn meanes to amend them.</p>

For ſome short ſpace before a Soule begins her Exerciſe of Meditation, let her looke vpon the Booke, and therin peruſe the Points that she intends to meditate on.

But as for ſuch Affections, let her abide in them as long as she can. (for therin conſiſts all the proffit.) And if vpon one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or Motiue she can produce many Acts of the vvill, let her not faile to doe ſo; and to continue in each Act as long as she finds that she is enabled.

So that they may doe very vvell <hi>monthly</hi> (or as occaſion shall require) by ſuch <hi>Retirements</hi> to encreaſe their light, and to lay vp a Treaſure of good purpoſes and Aduices for the time follovving: By vvhich practiſe an vſe and habituall State of Recollectednes may be attained, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made that it be not extinguished by future Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments.</p>

                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48407:316"/>5. But if <hi>the End</hi> of ſuch <hi>Retraites</hi> be only to oblige ſoules to a nice Obſeruance and practiſe of Meditation, merely for the foreſayd purpoſes, vvithout any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of aduancing them in <hi>Affectiue Prayer,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined vvhat benefit <hi>Contemplatiue ſoules</hi> can reape therby, but rather a hindrance and diſtraction. For. 1. <hi>they are</hi> ſuppoſed not to ſtand in need novv to learne hovv to pray <hi>Mentally:</hi> to vvhich kind of Prayer the ſayd Exerciſes are but the firſt imperfect Rudiments. 2. <hi>Much leſſe</hi> doe they ſtand in need of a totall Change of Life: Or of doing ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Penitentiall Satisfaction for former Crimes: or to learne remorſe for them. 3. <hi>By ſuch Exerciſes,</hi> as they are commonly taught and practiſed, ſuch ſoules vvill not learne hovv vvell to practiſe their Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruances in Solitude, or to vſe vocall Prayer of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation more perfectly. For all ſuch Exerciſes, vnleſſe they be practiſed in Order to Affectiue Prayer, doe <hi>end in themſelues,</hi> not being intended to be meanes to leade ſoules to higher Prayer &amp;c. 4. <hi>And in caſe</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be naturally indiſpoſed for Internall Diſcourſiue Prayer, vvhat is it that they can learne therby? (Which is very ordinarily the caſe, eſpecially of many Religious Women.)</p>
                        <p n="6">6. All things therfore conſidered, Nothing ſeemes to mee more improper, then the ſayd Retraits for Meditation are for ſolitary Contemplatiues, to vvhom a due <hi>Obſeruance of the Quire</hi> is both far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and efficacious to all Ends pretended to by ſuch Exerciſes, then they are. Yea moreouer great harme
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48407:316"/> may come to ſoules profeſſing Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation by them; For ſo great attention, ſuch an exact performance of nice obſeruances, and ſuch a captiuity of ſpirit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that vvhen all is paſſed, ſoules thereby of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times become diſabled to continue the Internall Prayer proper for them, or to comply vvith many Regular Duties.

                        <p n="7">7. Therfore as touching Contemplatiue Perſons, vvho (liuing perhaps vnder the Conduct of thoſe that are vvholly deuoted to the Actiue vvay) shall be obliged to ſuch Retirements, and therin to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes very vnſuitable to their State, <hi>my Aduice</hi> to them is, <hi>That</hi> they should keepe themſelues in as much ſtillnes of mind as may be; and hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Inſtructions for their Prayer, let them in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe giue as much ſcope as they vvell can to their good Affections; not much troubling themſelues vvhether the ſayd Affections be proper to the matter propoſed for Meditation, or no; nor diſtracting themſelues vvith reflection vpon their Prayer, to the End to giue <hi>an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of it to others. Let them likevviſe endeauour to preſerue all due <hi>liberty in Spirit</hi> in their Examinations and Confeſſions, therin proceeding no further then may conſiſt vvith their Spirituall proffit: and by all meanes auoyding ſuch particulars as are likely to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Feare and Scrupuloſity, or to diſturbe the Peace of their Minds.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="120" facs="tcp:48407:317"/>8. And as for <hi>Secular liuers</hi> to vvhom indeede the ſayd <hi>Retraites</hi> (according to cuſtome vndertaken at ſet times) may proue of admirable proffit and benefit, to the end the vertue of them may not quickly expire, they ought to be carefull aftervvards to make good vſe of the lights receiued in them, and to put in execution the good purpoſes made during ſuch <hi>Retirements.</hi> For they muſt not expect by a fevv daies ſolitude and Praier to get a habit of Sanctity, but only a tranſient good Paſſion and diſpoſition therto, which vvithout future care to cherish and encreaſe it, vvill quickly vanish, and their feruour vvill be cooled.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Moreouer perceiuing euidently by this experience the good effects of Mentall Prayer, they ought to reſolue the beſt they can to allovv ſome reaſonable time to the proſecution of it vvhen they returne to their Secular Vocations, vſing likevviſe as much abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as their State of life vvill permit.

                        <p n="10">10.

For though in it ſelfe it be very good to ſeeke all good meanes to procure Remorſe and Contrition for paſt ſins: yet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48407:317"/> if a ſoule vpon a conſideration that she has ſuch a <hi>ſpeciall Remedy</hi> in a readines, shall neglect the care &amp; vvatchfullnes ouer herſelfe, it is to be feared, &amp; not vvithout iuſt grounds, that that vvhich she takes for contrition vvill proue to be no more then a naturall Remorſe: For it is not likely that God vvill shovvre dovvne his Grace vpon a ſoule ſo corrupted in her Intention.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>IT is impoſsible</hi> for a ſoule that leades an abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Life, and diligently purſues Internall Praier, to fixe continually in Meditation, or to reſt in any
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48407:318"/> Degree of Affectiue Praier: Becauſe the Nature of ſuch Intellectuall &amp; Spirituall Operations is to become more and more pure, abſtracted &amp; vniuerſall, and to cary the vvill and Affections of the ſoule ſtill higher and further into God: the <hi>Actiuity of the Imagination</hi> &amp; vnderſtanding continually abating, &amp; the <hi>Actiuity of the Will</hi> continually increaſing, and getting ground v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the vnderſtanding, till at laſt all its operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s become ſo quieted and ſilenced, that they ceaſe, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnperceptible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſoule therfore being thus inuited and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to approach continually nearer and nearer vnto God, if she be either by her ovvne or others igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſo <hi>fettered with cuſtomes</hi> or <hi>Rules,</hi> that she is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of due <hi>Liberty of Spirit</hi> to correſpond to ſuch an Inuitation, and to quit inferiour Exerciſes, she vvill find no proffit at all by her Praier, but on the contrary extreme paine, vvhich vvill endanger to force her to relinquish her Recollections.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is othervviſe vvith thoſe vvhoſe <hi>Profeſsion</hi> is to liue <hi>Actiue,</hi> diſtracted <hi>Liues,</hi> though they doe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly aſpire to the Perfection anſvverable to that ſtate. For ſuch may continue all their liues in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and follovv the Methods of it: Becauſe what they looſe by their Diſtractions, they may recouer by their follovving Meditation, the good Images vſed therin expelling the vaine Images contracted in their Externall Employments. True it is, that to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Meditation vvill grovv more and more pure, and more in ſpirit: yet neuer ſo as to exclude a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vſe of the Imagination.</p>

                           <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48407:318"/>4. When <hi>a Contemplatiue Soule</hi> therfore hath for ſome reaſonable time practiſed Meditation, and comes to perceiue that a further Exerciſe therof is become dry and vngratefull to her Spirit, cauſing great diſguſt and little or no proffit: She ought then <hi>to forbeare Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to betake herſelfe to the Exerciſe of <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Acts,</hi> vvhich she vvill then doubtles performe vvith great guſt and facility, to her notable proffit in Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is a great miſtake in ſome Writers, vvho thinke the <hi>Exerciſe of the will</hi> to be <hi>meane</hi> and baſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Inuentiue Meditation,</hi> and curious Speculation of Diuine Myſteries: in as much as none but eleuated Spirits can performe this, vvhereas the moſt ignorant and ſimple perſons can exerciſe Acts or Affections of the vvill. On the contrary it is moſt certaine, that <hi>no Act of the vnderſtanding</hi> (as <hi>Speculation, conſideration, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Concluſions</hi> &amp;c.) in matters pertaining to God, are of themſelues of any vertue to giue true Perfection to a ſoule, further then as they doe excite <hi>the Will</hi> to loue him, and by loue to be vnited to him. And this <hi>Vnion</hi> by exerciſe may be obtained in Perfection by ſoules that are not at all capable of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that haue no more knovvledge of God then vvhat is afforded from a beleife of the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall verities</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> So that it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>the End of all Meditation</hi> &amp;c, <hi>is the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Acts of the Will.</hi> Therfore let no man neglect or ſcorne the Exerciſe proper for him, out of a conceit that it is too meane: but let him firſt try the proffit of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48407:319"/> it, and not till then make a iudgment.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Others there are, that doe indeed perſvvade ſoules in due time to quit the Exerciſes of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for thoſe of the Will: But yet alvvaies vvith <hi>one Exception</hi> and reſeruation, to vvit, of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation on the Paſsion of our Lord:</hi> This, ſay they, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be ſayd aſide, but vvill be a ſubiect fit for the Conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation of the moſt Perfect. What an ingratitude vvould it be to God; (ſay they) &amp; vvhat a neglect of our Soules good, purpoſely to forbeare a frequent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Myſtery, the ground of all our Happines, the Roote of all Merit, the Supremeſt teſtimony of Diuine Loue towards vs, the moſt inuiting and vvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obiect of loue from vs to God, the terrour of all our Spirituall Enemies &amp;c?

                        <p n="9">9. <hi>This Diuine obiect</hi> therfore is far from being loſt or forgotten by ſuch proceeding in Prayer: yea it is in a far more noble manner both commemorated and imitated. And ſurely to tye the Soule generally in all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48407:320"/> Recollections to a particular curious reflexion on the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> belonging to <hi>our Lords Paſsion,</hi> vvould be as if one vvould oblige a perſon that can reade per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and vvith one glance of his eye ioyne a vvhole ſentence together, to make an expreſſe and diſtinct Reflexion on each letter, ſyllable and vvord: Such a framing and multiplying of Images vvould only ſerue to obſcure the mind and coole the Affections. Well may ſuch Deuout Soules out of time of Prayer, in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or diſcourſing admit ſuch Images, and receiue benefit by them in future Recollections: But vvhen they actually pray, then to be forced to ſtop and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the vvill from melting into Diuine Loue, or from ſacrificing herſelfe to God by Perfect Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c, till she haue paſſed through her former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Method of Imaginatiue Meditation, is all one as to forbid Soules to vnite themſelues in Spirit to the Diuinity.</p>
                        <p n="10">10.

                        <p n="15">15. <hi>A change,</hi> vvhenſoeuer it is made as it ought to be, conſiſts in this, <hi>That the Actiuity of the Fancy and Diſcourſe is abated, and the whole Internall Exerciſe of Prayer by little is reduced to blind operations of the will:</hi> The vvhich operations (or Affections) likevviſe grovv by practiſe more and more naturall, quiet, pure, ſilent, ſubtile, imperceptible, and profound: <hi>The Diuine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> dravving the Soule in her Exerciſes euer more and more vnto it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Ordinarily vvhen a time of <hi>Change</hi> from a more imperfect to a more ſublime Exerciſe of Prayer cometh; it vvill not on the ſudden, or at once be perceiued; or but very obſcurely &amp; doubtfully. Only a Soule vvill perceiue a bettring in her Exerciſes, her operations by little and little becoming more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. And indeed in ſome Perſons there is almoſt dayly a bettering and purifying of their Prayer: The vvhich themſelues doe, or may vvell enough obſerue;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48407:322"/> though perhaps they are not able to expreſſe the manner of it to another, by reaſon of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Far <hi>leſſe Inconueniences</hi> vvould follovv by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Soule ſomevvhat too long in an humble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Exerciſe (as of Meditation) vvhen she is fit and ripe for a more ſublime one: Then if (through inconſideration, leuity, or an ambitious humour to imitate Examples or Inſtructions in Bookes, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to her) she should at the firſt, or before her time be put into one aboue her preſent Capacity. For in the former caſe an eaſy and preſent <hi>Remedy</hi> may be found, by exalting the Soule aftervvard to a more perfect Exerciſe ſuitable to her preſent Diſpoſition: till vvhich be done, she vvill at leaſt exerciſe her <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and Submiſſion of Iudgment, by vvhich she vvill receiue much proffit. But it is very difficult to find <hi>a Remedy</hi> in the other caſe: Becauſe <hi>firſt</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnvvillingnes and shame that is in Soules to acknovvledge their too haſty <hi>Ambition,</hi> and to deſcend lovver, vvill ſecretly hinder them: And <hi>beſides,</hi> they vvill be ready to iuſtify themſelues by miſapplying certaine Documents in <hi>Spirituall Authours,</hi> vvhich forbid Soules to quit their preſent Exerciſes for one inferiour, through any diſcouragement from <hi>Aridities</hi> or vnſatisfaction found in them. Notvvithſtanding except they vvill be content vvith the <hi>Mortification</hi> of returning to Meditation (in caſe they be not yet ripe for Immediate Acts of the vvill) they vvill be in danger of incurring an <hi>habituall Dryenes,</hi> Melancholy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48407:322"/> and ſtupidity; and moreuer they vvill run into an endles <hi>labarynth,</hi> perplexing and entangling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therin, to the great diſquiet of their ovvne minds, and the troubling of others vvith queſtions and doubts.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Yet it cannot be denyed, but that God doth often inuite Soules to ſome change in Prayer accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that vvhich before they had read in ſome Bookes: And then they are to follovv the Inſtructions of ſuch a Booke, as a light ſent them from God. In vvhich caſe, it is indeed the <hi>ſecret motion</hi> and <hi>Inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> afforded them by God to apply ſuch Inſtructions, that is their ſure <hi>Guide:</hi> vvithout vvhich they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply nothing that they find in Bookes.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. More particularly, by theſe follovving <hi>Signes</hi> a Deuout Soule may for the moſt part perceiue and iudge vvhen it is fit for her to change her Exerciſes of Prayer, (as for example, to quit <hi>Meditation</hi> and to betake her ſelfe to <hi>a Praier of the Will</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                        <p n="20">20. <hi>Firſt</hi> she vvill not find that pleaſure, ſatisfaction and proffit in her preſent Exerciſe, vvhich formerly she did: But on the contrary, a ſenſible Diſguſt and a kind of Impotency to practiſe Internall Diſcourſe any longer. Or if she vvill force herſelfe to obſerue her Method of Meditating, it vvill produce no effect vpon her Affections: the vvhich if they vvere left to themſelues, vvould flovv far more freely. And this <hi>Diſguſt</hi> is not for once or tvvice: nor as formerly, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon occaſion of ſome corporall diſtemper, Paſſion, Aridity, or any vnuſuall accident: But it is <hi>a laſting
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48407:323"/> Diſguſt,</hi> ariſing from a deſire to pleaſe God, and to grovv in Perfection, ioynd vvith an vncertainty or feare that the vvay vvherin she novv is, is not proper to effect that deſire.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. <hi>Secondly,</hi> she vvill thereupon find in her ſelfe a certaine <hi>Motion</hi> or invvard inuitation to enter into ſome other <hi>new Exerciſe,</hi> at yet not clearly knovvn to her. Or if there be no nevv Exerciſe propoſed to her, there is hovveuer a <hi>Motion to a ceſsation from the preſent Exerciſe,</hi> at leaſt for as much as concernes the manner of it.

                        <p n="24">24. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> as ſoone as she is vvell entred into this nevv Exerciſe, preſently she vvill find it guſtfull &amp; delightfull vnto her: and vvithall much more proffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then vvas the other formerly practiſed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon she vvill thenceforvvard vvith courage and ioy perſeuere in it.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. By ſuch <hi>ſteps</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> doth a ſoule, that is purely vnder the Guidance of Gods Holy Spirit, paſſe from one degree of Prayer to another formerly vnknovven vnto her, till at laſt she come to <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</hi> And she vvill clearly perceiue that it vvas not herſelfe, but God only that did as it vvere lead her by the hand, and dravv her forvvard into the nevv Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.

Wheras in the purſuance of it she aftervvards proceedes as it vvere by her ovvne habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall skill, though really God is in euery thing her ſecret Maiſter and Helper. And he deales vvith an humble ſoule, as <hi>a writing Maister</hi> vvith his <hi>Scholler,</hi> vvho at firſt moues and directs his hand to forme &amp; ioyne letters: but aftervvard directs him only vvith his Eye and Tongue; Or <hi>as a Father</hi> that caries his child ouer a Ditch or Stile: but lets him goe alone in the euen plaine way.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. And as for a Soule that by <hi>Reading,</hi> or <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> is informed in the Nature and Degrees of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48407:324"/> Prayer, her proceeding and Tranſition is much after the ſame manner: <hi>Excepting only</hi> that the Next Degree to vvhich she is to aſcend does not ſeeme ſo ſtrange to her. But the <hi>ſignes</hi> by vvhich a neceſſity of change doth appeare are, as formerly, a conſtant diſguſt in her preſent Exerciſe (of Meditation &amp;c.) and a kind of diſability to continue it vvith any prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to her ſpirit: By vvhich meanes it comes to paſſe that in her Recollections the Meditating or <hi>Diſcourſing part</hi> diminishes dayly, and <hi>the Affectiue part</hi> encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: <hi>the Will</hi> by little and little getting ground of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> till at laſt the Prayer becomes entirely of the <hi>will.</hi> And thus she paſſes almoſt vnavvares into the next Degree, her Prayer becoming by little and little more and more purifyed. Into the vvhich Degree vvhen she is in ſuch a manner and order entred, then indeed she is not for any <hi>Aridities,</hi> or obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to quit it, and to returne to Meditation: But to vſe <hi>a diſcreete violence</hi> vpon the <hi>will</hi> to make it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good Affections and Acts, although nature take little comfor or ſatisfaction in the Exerciſe. For by ſo doing she vvill much benefit herſelfe, both by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Nature; and fixing Diuine Loue more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly in the Spirituall Region of the ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. To conclude this Point: A Spirituall life is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many and vvonderfull <hi>Changes, Interiour</hi> as vvell as <hi>Exteriour:</hi> And all are according to the mere vvill and good pleaſure of God, vvho is tyed to no Methods or Rules.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48407:330"/> I did not not conceiue any neceſſity to annexe any Exerciſes of <hi>Meditation:</hi> Partly becauſe it vvas not my deſigne to treat of that degree of Prayer, but only <hi>paſsingly</hi> &amp; in order to affectiue Prayer, to vvhich it is but a remote preparation: And beſides there are Patternes of ſuch exerciſes abundantly obuious to euery one, the vvhich may ſuffiſe any Internall liuer, being practiſed according to the inſtructions here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly giuen.

                        <p n="2">2. As touching therfore the foreſaid <hi>Exerciſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced immediate Acts of the Will</hi> &amp; affections, I haue compiled a ſufficient variety of them, proper for all ſtates &amp; diſpoſitions of ſoules: as <hi>Acts of Remorſe, Feare, Contrition &amp;c.</hi> (vvhich belong to the <hi>Purgatiue way:</hi>) And likevviſe <hi>Acts of Adoration, Glorification, Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reſignation, &amp; Loue (which belong to the Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue &amp; Vnitiue Wayes.)</hi> I haue moreouer made ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Exerciſes of Affections,</hi> more proper for ſome ſoules, then are thoſe vvhich I call <hi>Acts of the Will.</hi> Beſides, I haue ſet dovvne moſt copiouſly <hi>Patternes</hi>

But the caſe is othervviſe vvith a ſoule that is found vtterly vnfit for <hi>Meditation,</hi> and conſequently muſt neceſſarily begin a ſpirituall courſe vvith the <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Immediate Acts.</hi> For for ſuch a ſoule (ordinarily ſpeaking) it vvill be expedient that at the beginning she take for the matter of her <hi>Acts</hi> ſuch as are proper for the <hi>Purgatiue Way,</hi> as Acts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Feare of Iudgment, Hell</hi> &amp;c.

For othervviſe she vvill ſpend the precious time allotted for Prayer in looking here and there for ſomevvhat that may be pleaſing to her fancy or humour, &amp; yet in the end perhaps not content herſelfe; Or at the leaſt the ſatisfaction that she may come to find vvill
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48407:332"/> ſcarce counteruaile the diſtraction incurred, and time loſt.

                        <p n="8">8.

                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:48407:332"/> or Deteſtation of ſin be rather exerciſed <hi>in a generality,</hi> or Vertually, in <hi>Acts of Conuerſion to God,</hi> then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, directly and expreſſely.

                        <p n="11">11. A ſoule hauing pitched vpon any Act or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction contained in the ſayd Exerciſes, let her tarry as long vpon each of them, vvithout paſſing to an other, as her <hi>Guſt</hi> vnto ſuch an affection laſteth, and as she findes proffit to her ſpirit by it.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Whenſoeuer in any <hi>Clauſe</hi> there is contained matter of ſeuerall deſires or Affections, let her in her, mind and Exerciſing ſeparate them, and reſt vpon each of them ſeuerally: For by this meanes the ſayd Exerciſes vvill laſt longer, and yeild more prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. After that all the Exerciſes, appointed for her, haue bene paſſed ouer, let her repeate and purſue them againe and againe: Vnleſſe she doe find herſelfe dravven by God to ſome other Exerciſe more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as is that of <hi>Aſpirations.</hi> And indeed vvhenſoeuer in her Exerciſe during her Recollection, shee does find her ſelfe moued to <hi>perfect Aſpirations, Eleuations of the Will</hi> &amp;c: or elſe to produce ſome <hi>other Acts,</hi> as of <hi>Reſignation</hi> &amp;c vpon occaſion of ſome preſent

                        <p n="14">14.

                        <p n="15">15. The <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> in the follovving Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are for the moſt part <hi>directed to God</hi> himſelfe, or <hi>the pure Diuinity:</hi> as if they vvere internall conuerſations vvith God: The vvhich are <hi>perfect introuerſions,</hi> and of all actiue, aſſumed Exerciſes are the moſt prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. But vvithall ſuch <hi>Actuations</hi> are oftimes very painefull: by reaſon that ſuch Introuerſions are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed vvithout the helpe of groſſer Images (the vvhich haue ſome kind of recreating diuerſion in them:) and vvhen ſuch Images doe offer themſelues, the ſoule ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>naked Diuinity,</hi> taries not in them, but tranſcends or reiects them. And if her mind finding no Guſt in an Obiect ſo perfectly ſpirituall, becomes vvilling to eaſe it ſelfe by faſtning vpon ſome other good, but inferiour Obiect, she is by ſome <hi>Writers</hi> taught to vvithdravv her attention from any thing but God: the vvhich violence and ſelfe contradiction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vvithout much paine; in ſo much that ſoules become therby ſometimes ſo tired vvith ſuch <hi>Introuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and find ſo great difficulty in ſeeking the <hi>Diuine Preſence</hi> ſo aboue the courſe of nature, that they looſe

                        <p n="17">17. Therfore in ſuch caſes it not only may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but ought to be enioyned vnto a ſoule to giue eaſe vnto herſelfe by quitting for a time ſuch painfull <hi>introuerſions</hi> and <hi>addreſſes</hi> to the Pure Diuinity, and inſtead therof exerciſe herſelfe in producing other Acts leſſe painfull becauſe leſſe introuerting, as <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Affections to the Humanity of our Lord,</hi> to <hi>Angells, Saints</hi> &amp;c: yea she may ſometimes addreſſe her Internall ſpeech to <hi>her owne ſoule,</hi> or to ſome <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>creatures abſent:</hi> yet all <hi>with reference to God:</hi> for othervviſe it vvould not be an <hi>Act of Religion,</hi> nor proffitable to the ſoule.</p>

                        <p n="22">22. The truth is: vvhatſouer kind of <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions</hi> a ſoule vſeth, if they be conſtantly practiſed <hi>they will all end in God;</hi> ſo that euen <hi>the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> among thoſe that God calls to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation Praier, though they knovv no other practiſe of deuotion but the <hi>Roſary,</hi> &amp; cannot begin their Recollections any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvay then by turning their thoughts tovvards the <hi>bleſſed Virgin,</hi> vvhoſe protection &amp; interceſſion they craue; yet being by that meanes become profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introuerted, they quickly leaue all direct &amp; expreſſe addreſſes <hi>to her,</hi> &amp; are lead, vnavvares perhaps to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to the <hi>vnknown obſcure Obiect of the Diuinity,</hi> in vvhich they plunge &amp; looſe themſelues.

                        <p n="23">23. <hi>The generall Rule</hi> &amp; Aduice therfore in this matter is, that accordingly as ſoules vpon experience &amp; obſeruation doe find themſelues diſpoſed to any kinds of Acts or affections, vvhether of one kind only or ſeuerall kinds mixed together, ſo they muſt order their exerciſes, &amp; recollections; preferring the ſauour &amp; proffit that their ſoules find in them, before any Rules, methods or authority of Examples.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. Some fevv ſoules there are to vvhom <hi>one only Exerciſe</hi> vvithout any change or variety may ſuffiſe for their vvhole life, till they arriue to perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. So that their <hi>aduancement</hi> vvill conſiſt only in the <hi>degrees of Purity</hi> &amp; recollection vvith vvhich they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48407:335"/> performe the ſaid exerciſe.

And againe, ſoules vvill be apt to be cloyed &amp; to haue an auerſion from an affection or deſire after they haue fed vpon it for ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time. 2. <hi>ſuch as</hi> vvithall haue a very ſtrong &amp; vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Call from God</hi> to ſeeke him in his internall vvayes, ioyned vvith naturall aptnes to an internall life; The vvhich aptnes conſiſts in a ſtability of the imagination, &amp; a quietnes of Paſſions.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. For ſuch ſoules as theſe it vvill be beſt that they should be confined to one exerciſe, ſuch an one as that is vvhich <hi>Bloſius</hi> in his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> hath framed, &amp; profeſſeth that by a diligent proſecution thereof (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvith <hi>mortification</hi>) a ſoule may attaine to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; <hi>myſtick Vnion. A patterne of ſuch an Exerciſe</hi> conformable to the direction of <hi>Bloſius</hi> (vvho ſeemes to haue practiſed it himſelfe) I vvill ſet dovvn among the follovving <hi>Formes of Exerciſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="26">26. And indeed one ſingular <hi>Benefit</hi> that ſuch ſoules vvill reape by being conſtant to one exerciſe, is this, <hi>that they will</hi> neuer be to ſeeke for it, nor ſtand in need of bookes: becauſe after a little practiſe they vvill haue it in their hearts &amp; memories. Only, good care muſt be had to fit the exerciſe to the ſoule, giuing a ſcope &amp; atitude ſufficient to it, that it may comprehend in it Acts ſuitable to ſeuerall ſtates of the ſoule, that is,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48407:335"/> both <hi>Acts of Contrition,</hi> &amp; likevviſe of the <hi>exerciſe of the principall Vertues;</hi> (among all vvhich, the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, proffitable &amp; laſting are the <hi>Acts of Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>) In the Exerciſe of vvhich it vvill be good for the ſoule to abide till she be fitted &amp; called by God to <hi>Pure Aſpirations;</hi> for then all manner of preſcribed Exerciſes muſt ceaſe, becauſe then a ſoule doth not pray by her ovvne Election, but by an Internall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the Diuine Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Some <hi>Spirituall Writers</hi> for this purpoſe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>our Lords Prayer</hi> for a conſtant Exerciſe in dayly Recollections, aduiſing ſuch ſoules to exerciſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately euery Petition as a ſeuerall Act, dvvelling on each as long as they can find relish in it; And ſo doing they shall be ſure not to omit any thing that a ſoule can or ought to pray for. And this <hi>Aduice</hi> is ſuitable to the teaching of <hi>an Ancient holy Hermite,</hi> vvhoſe vvords recorded by <hi>Caſsianus</hi> (9. Conf. c. 25.) are theſe, <hi>Haec oratio licet omnem videatur Perfectionis plenitudinem continere, vtpote &amp;c:</hi> that is, <hi>This Prayer of our Lord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may ſeeme to containe in it the fullnes of all perfection, as being either begun or established by our Lords owne Authority: yet it doth promote thoſe that are familiarly exerciſed in it to that far more ſublime ſtate which wee mentioned before; conducting them to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed Prayer, that far more ſupereminent actuation of ſoule, known or experienced by very few, yea (to ſpeake more properly) altogether inexpreſsible; The which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending all humane ſenſe or knowledge, is not diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by any ſound of ſpeech, or motion of the tongue, nor
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48407:336"/> any pronunciation of words; But it is a degree of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime. Braier which the Spirit illustrated by an Infuſion of heauenly Light, doth not deſigne or expreſse by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane language; but hauing all the ſenſes &amp; faculties vnited &amp; conglobated, it doth plentifully gush it forth but of the heart, as water out of a copious fountaine, &amp; ineffably powreth it out vnto our Lord, in that one short moment of time ſending forth ſo many &amp; ſo great deſires, as the ſoule herſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making a reflexion on her owne operations, is not able to declare, nor euen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="28">28. But it is not ordinary to find ſoules ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their imaginations, &amp; reſolute in their vvills, as to content themſelues vvith one only exerciſe. And for this reaſon I haue made <hi>a Collection of ſeuerall kinds,</hi> vvith ſufficient variety &amp; mixture. Theſe I haue gathered out of ſeuerall Bookes, vſing mine owne liberty and iudgment in altering them ſo as to make them more proper for thoſe that proſecute internall affectiue Prayer, &amp; for that purpoſe oftimes leauing out many diſcourſes &amp; conſiderations intermingled vvith them in the bookes out of vvhich they haue bene extracted.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. Novv I doe not pretend nor deſire that ſoules practiſing <hi>Affectiue</hi> prayer should oblige themſelues to theſe particular Exerciſes, or to the order obſerued in them. They may if they conceiue it for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, frame other exerciſes for their ovvne vſe; Either by ſelecting here &amp; there out of theſe or out of any other bookes ſuch acts or Affections as they shall find
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48407:336"/> agreeing to their ſpirit. But hauing framed ſuch a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, I vvould ſeriouſly aduiſe them to practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aduices here ſet downe, eſpecially in this Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. The <hi>reading</hi> of ſome pious <hi>Diſcourſe before Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> vſually practiſed in Communities, is a good &amp; proffitable practiſe, but eſpecially proper for ſoules that are not aduanced beyond <hi>Meditation;</hi> vvho may doe vvell to attend to the Myſtery read, that after they may make it the matter of their prayer: <hi>Yet better</hi> it vvere they should haue the matter of their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> prepared before-hand; becauſe it is to be feared that by <hi>once Reading</hi> ouer the poynts of a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> they vvill not be ſufficiently imprinted in the memory, ſo as to be made vſe of.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. But as for ſoules that are in the practiſe of <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Acts of the will,</hi> I should not require of them the like attention; But rather that they vvould employ that time in chaſing away diſtracting Images; in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelues in the diuine preſence; in begging Gods aſſiſtance; &amp; directing their follovving Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to his glory. And if in their priuate Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections they shall premiſe ſome competent Reading, I conceiue that <hi>S. Augustins Confeſsions, Soliloquies; The Imitation of Christ,</hi> &amp; ſuch other bookes affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuouſly vvritten, vvill be moſt commodious for them; or aboue all, certaine paſſages of the <hi>holy Goſpells</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome vvords ſpoken by <hi>our Lord</hi> himſelfe will likely be a moſt proffitable &amp; effectuall Preparation. But <hi>no certaine Rules</hi> can be preſcribed for theſe things;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48407:337"/> Euery one therfore is to chuſe that Booke &amp; ſubiect that he finds moſt proper for him.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. When the preparation by <hi>Reading</hi> is paſt, let the perſon applying himſelfe to his recollection, looke vpon the matter of the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Affection</hi> that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to employ his Praier vpon; And after this vvithdrawing his eyes from the booke, let him thinke awhile vpon it, framing a ſpirituall image or concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And vvhen that is done, let him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith produce an Act or Affection to God anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the matter, reſting thereon as long as the vertue thereof laſteth; And ſo proceede to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving Acts in like manner.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Some ſoules there are that through <hi>a ſecret na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Quality</hi> in their <hi>Internall ſenſes</hi> cannot ſo worke vvith the imagination as to produce an <hi>Image</hi> that may become a matter of Prayer to them. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſequently are not fit for the exerciſe of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acts of the vvill (&amp; much leſſe for meditation.) They are therfore to apply themſelues to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of pious deſires or Amorous Affections. But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſoules are ſo diſpoſed as to be rather enabled for <hi>Acts</hi> of the vvill then <hi>affections,</hi> yet ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they vvill find Affections more flovving then Acts; And therfore accordingly they are to giue vvay to them.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. It may happen ſometimes to deuout ſoules that they may find themſelues <hi>diſabled</hi> to either of them. In ſuch caſe I vvould aduiſe them to vſe <hi>a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet violence</hi> on themſelues to exerciſe ſome good Acts
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48407:337"/> moſt relishing to them (for vvhere force is to be vſed, there Acts to be exerciſed by the ſuperiour vvill are rather to be choſen, then Affections:) But if after triall they find that they are not able to continue in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained an Exerciſe, &amp; ſo are at a ſtand, &amp; likely to ſpend the time appoynted in an <hi>vnproffitable Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> let them try if <hi>a more imperfect exerciſe</hi> vvill fit them, either <hi>ſpeaking to God in the third perſon,</hi> as if he vvere abſent, or vvould not heare them; Or addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelues to <hi>Angells, Saints,</hi> or to <hi>their owne ſoules</hi> &amp;c. And if they cannot performe euen this <hi>mentally,</hi> that is, neither vvith attention, nor guſt; let them doe it at leaſt <hi>vocally;</hi> vvithall exerciſing as much patience, ſtillnes &amp; quietnes, as may be; And doing thus, let them aſſure themſelues that therby they vvill afford vnto their ſpirits a good vvholeſome &amp; proffitable, though taſtles, repaſt.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. But if after all this it should happen (vvhich vvould be very ſtrange) that they should find all theſe vvayes inſupportable to them, ſo <hi>that they can doe nothing at oll,</hi> both the vndeſtanding &amp; vvill failing them; Then, ſince no <hi>Actiue</hi> vvorking, Externall or internall, vvill helpe them, they may conceiue it to be the caſe of <hi>an extraordinary deſolation &amp; deſertion;</hi> So that their only recourſe muſt be to pure ſuffring with patience &amp; Reſignation; exerciſing theſe the beſt they can in ſuch circumſtances. The vvhich if they vvill doe, then vvill this afflicting deſolation really prooue more proffitable then a ſtate &amp; Prayer of light and comfort. The vvhich proffit is ſcarce perceptible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48407:338"/> the ſpirit of God vvorkes more <hi>intimely</hi> in the depth of the ſpirit; but therfore is more efficacious to the ſoules aduancement.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. In this caſe I should ſcarce allow the <hi>ſuffring ſoule</hi> to diuert &amp; eaſe her mind by reading (&amp; much leſſe by any corporall exerciſe) during the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for her Recollection. Or if ſo, as ſoone as euer she finds by a little glancing on a booke, an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be raiſed, let her purſue the ſaid affection &amp; quit reading preſently; for <hi>Reading</hi> at ſuch times being allovved merely for neceſſity, ought to be vſed no further then neceſſity shall require.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. No certaine Rules or determinations can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the time that ſoules are to be detained in the exerciſe of certaine kinds of Acts, as of Contrition &amp; others of the <hi>Purgatiue way,</hi> before they paſſe into thoſe of Reſignation or loue (vvhich are of the vnitiue vvay.) Only in generall it may be ſaid, <hi>that</hi> the longer &amp; deeper that ſoules haue bene plunged in vicious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, the longer (probably) vvill it be before they be ripe for ſuch a <hi>paſsage:</hi> yet that time may be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by feruour in prayer &amp; mortification. <hi>To ſome,</hi> fevv months vvill ſuffiſe to remaine in Acts of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c: <hi>To ſome</hi> not many dayes; yea <hi>ſome ſoules</hi> (as tender innocent virgins &amp;c:) are ſo vvell affected to God &amp; ſo vnacquainted vvith vicious cuſtomes, that they may <hi>at the firſt</hi> be put into <hi>Acts of Reſignation</hi> or loue.</p>
                        <p n="38">38. But herein euery one is to regard the ſtate of his ſoule &amp; conſcience; obſeruing vvhether he find
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48407:338"/> therein quietnes &amp; competent ſatisfaction; In vvhich caſe he may reaſonably iudge that he may relinquish the <hi>Acts of the Purgatiue way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="39">39. But as for giuing ouer the Acts of Reſignation &amp; loue &amp;c: from thence to paſſe to the exerciſe of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations,</hi> God knowes, <hi>a much longer ſpace</hi> of time is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, euen in ſoules the moſt innocent. For this ſublime exerciſe ariſing out of a <hi>ſetled habituall Charity</hi> fixed in the ſoule through long &amp; conſtant practiſe of forced Acts of the vvill, (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the teaching of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banſon,</hi> vvho ſaith, <hi>that ſoules may from Meditation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately paſſe to Aſpirations</hi>) it does not depend on mans choyce vvhen he vvill Exerciſe <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> of vvhich God alone is the mouer &amp; Directour. And vvhatſoeuer induſtry in Prayer a ſoule shall vſe, it is very vſuall that she should be enabled to arriue to this Exerciſe <hi>in Youth,</hi> before the boyling heat &amp; actiuity of nature be vvell qualified.</p>
                        <p n="40">40. Notvvithſtanding in vvhatſoeuer exerciſe a ſoule shall be, if ſuch <hi>Aſpirations</hi> doe offer themſelues, she is to giue vvay vnto them, &amp; as long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, she is to ceaſe all other forced &amp; elected Acts.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. To conclude theſe Inſtructions, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the follovving <hi>Patternes of Exerciſes of Acts</hi> &amp;c: are to be made vſe of only for a neceſſity, ſuch as commonly beginners haue, yea &amp; moſt ſoules euen after they haue for a good vvhile purſued this Internall Prayer. But as for thoſe vvhoſe <hi>Interiour,</hi> vvithout ſeeking abroad, doth miniſter ſufficient matter vnto them of <hi>Reſignation, loue</hi> &amp;c: either ſuggeſted by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48407:339"/> of occurring difficulties, or coming of it ſelfe into their minds, ſuch ſoules being enabled to pray vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any formes preſcribed, as long as they are ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <hi>furnished from within,</hi> are not to make vſe of exerciſes in bookes. And this may be the caſe euen of ſome imperfect ſoules, which may be preuented &amp; much holpen by God for the matter of their Prayer. But <hi>howeuer</hi> it is good that they should haue a Booke in readines to helpe them, in caſe they come to ſtand in need; leaſt for vvant of matter ſo ſuggeſted they should be idle &amp; at a ſtand. For ſuch muſt not rely vpon their <hi>firſt ſenſible feruour;</hi> but vvhen that ceaſes (as they are to expect that it vvill) they muſt not ſcorne to deſcend not only to make vſe of Bookes, but alſo to apply themſelues to inferiour Exerciſes &amp; helpes ſuitable to their imperfect ſtate.</p>

VVHERAS all <hi>Internall Affectiue Praier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth either 1. <hi>Of ſuch Affections</hi> as are apt to cauſe ſuitable motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in corporall nature. 2. <hi>Or of Acts of the will,</hi> produced by, and reſiding in the Superiour ſoule; As among <hi>holy Affections</hi> the principall is <hi>Loue,</hi> the ſource and mouer of all the reſt; ſo among all <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Acts of the will</hi> the moſt vſefull and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are thoſe of <hi>Reſignation</hi> or ſubmiſſion to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vvill.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Novv hauing in the <hi>Second Treatiſe</hi> ſpoken ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently concerning the nature and qualities of <hi>Diuine loue,</hi> I shall not need to giue more particular Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions hovv to employ that invvard affection of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> immediately to God in the exerciſe of Internall Prayer: the vvhich is to be regulated according to the Precepts formerly giuen. But as for the <hi>Exerciſe of Reſignation</hi> (vvhich is indeed an exerciſe <hi>of Loue</hi> too,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48407:340"/> but ſo as that it regards externall difficulties, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or matter about vvhich ſuch loue is expreſſed) it is an exerciſe that deſerues to be more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of, &amp; aboue all others moſt to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as being generally <hi>the moſt ſecure &amp; proffitable of all other Exerciſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. For though Acts of <hi>pure melting Loue to God,</hi> (in vvhich all <hi>Images</hi> of creatures, yea all direct repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of God are excluded) be in themſelues more perfect &amp; <hi>Vnitiue,</hi> then are <hi>Acts of Reſignation,</hi> vvhich inuolue in themſelues images of externall things (to vvit, the ſpeciall difficulties in vvhich the ſoule intends to reſigne herſelfe:) Notvvithſtanding to recompence this diſaduantage, there is in Acts of Reſignation far more ſecurity, and leſſe danger of propriety or ſelfe-intereſt then in Acts of immediate Loue: the vvhich being apt to cauſe ſtirrings and pleaſing motions in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall nature, very fevv ſoules can practiſe them pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vvithout propriety, except they be exalted to a ſupreme degree of ſpirituall Diuine Charity. <hi>Againe</hi> there is in Reſignation exerciſed more directly true Mortification and Contradiction to ſelfe Loue &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt then in any other kind of internall Prayer: and conſequently it is a Prayer more purifying, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the daily and hourely vſe that vvee haue thereof in vnauoydable occurring difficulties, it is of all other the <hi>moſt proffitable;</hi> And though <hi>Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation</hi> (vvhich are alſo the immediate fruits of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue) doe inuolue in themſelues images of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things; yet this is only in the beginning of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48407:340"/> Act, ſo that the ſoule doth not tarry in ſuch images, but preſently paſſes from and out of them into God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Good Lord! vvhat millions of queſtions, debates &amp; perills doth <hi>totall Reſignation</hi> cut of? And this not only for <hi>Meum &amp; tuum,</hi> or vvorldly propriety in a ſecular ſtate, for the regulating vvhereof there are ſuch endles volumes of <hi>vſeles &amp; perplexed Caſes</hi> diſperſed euery vvhere: But alſo in externall matters in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life, either vvith regard to Superiours, or among Religious Perſons themſelues, or tovvards Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; Yea &amp; for matters of doubts merely Internall, being ſuch as are in queſtion betvveene God &amp; fearfull or ſcrupulous Soules; <hi>All theſe,</hi> I ſay, <hi>are cut of by a totall Reſignation;</hi> the vvhich doth tend to ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, peace &amp; the poſſeſſion of that <hi>one thing</hi> vvhich <hi>our Sauiour</hi> ſaith is <hi>only</hi> to be counted <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to vvit, the <hi>Diuine will</hi> (vvhich is God himſelfe:) &amp; ſo doth reiect all other things that may hinder or delay the ſoule from attaining to that one only neceſſary good.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Hence it follovves, that that ſoule vvhich is reſigned both for externall &amp; internall matters, is not only freed from perills that may come from tentations or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; but in a manner from all doubts, queſtions and debates. Whereas the <hi>vnreſigned ſoule</hi> is in a ſtate vvherein nothing can ſatisfy or ſecure her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A ſoule that is in the practiſe of the Prayer of Reſignation ought not to interrupt or omit the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48407:341"/> of Acts conformable thereto, notvvithſtanding any failings or tranſgreſſings againſt good Reſolutions formerly made, if ſo be ſuch failings proceede out of frailty or ſudden Paſſions; (being then oftimes more in ſenſuality then in the ſuperiour vvill, &amp; ſo haue leſſe fault in them.) For notvvithſtanding ſuch failings, Reſignations heartily made vvill not proue in vaine, but in time vvill come to good iſſue.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In conſideration of the eminent <hi>Excellencie</hi> of this duty of <hi>Reſignation</hi> I haue adioyned ſeuerall <hi>Exerciſes of the Acts of that vertue,</hi> exemplifying in all kinds of difficulties, <hi>regarding either externall</hi> or <hi>Internall obiects,</hi> touching outvvard <hi>goods, freinds</hi> ctc: <hi>as likewiſe</hi> all accidents that may befall <hi>the body,</hi> as <hi>ſicknes, Paines, want of conueniences or neceſsaries</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>lastly</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>ſoule,</hi> as <hi>Aridities, Tentations</hi> &amp;c: for the practiſing of vvhich exerciſes, beſides the <hi>Aduices</hi> giuen in the laſt Chapter (vvhich ought to be applied to this preſent purpoſe) I thought expedient to adde certaine more <hi>peculiar inſtructions</hi> here follovving.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. When the <hi>Exerciſe of Reſignation in Prayer</hi> comes to be the ordinary daily exerciſe of a ſoule, then she is eſtablished in the <hi>Vnitiue way,</hi> properly ſo called. And vvell-minded quiet ſoules vvill ſoone be ready and ripe for the practiſe both externall &amp; internall of this heauenly Vertue.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Concerning the matter or <hi>obiects of reſignation</hi> (the vvhich are generally matters of difficulty &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to nature) either they are. 1. <hi>Such difficulties</hi> as are ſure to happen. 2. <hi>Or only probably</hi> (of vvhich
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48407:341"/> probably there may be ſeuerall degrees.) 3. <hi>Or very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,</hi> but yet <hi>poſsible.</hi> 4. <hi>or</hi> laſtly <hi>altogether impoſsible.</hi> Novv in all theſe, Reſignation may be proffitably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. But <hi>the better</hi> the more likely that the things are to happen: And <hi>the beſt</hi> &amp; moſt neceſſary Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all is in things ſure to be fall vs, &amp; vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our ſtate; eſpecially ſuch againſt vvhich our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture finds the greateſt difficulty.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Novv ſince theſe laſt doe moſt frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to our minds in our Recollections; therfore vvee muſt be the more induſtrious &amp; courageous to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them by framing <hi>Internall</hi> Acts of our <hi>iudgment</hi> &amp; <hi>will</hi> to entertaine the ſaid difficulties, that ſo vvee may be prepared againſt the time that they doe really befall vs.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Novv hauing made efficacious &amp; preualent <hi>Acts of Internall Reſignation:</hi> if vvhen the ſaid difficulties doe <hi>de facto</hi> happen, vvee doe <hi>truly &amp; really accept &amp;</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them vvith our ſuperiour vvill (vvhatſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance vvee find in our ſenſitiue nature) this vvill much more aduance the ſoule in diuine loue &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the good habit of <hi>Reſignation,</hi> then many bare Internall Acts vvould doe, by vvhich the ſoule doth only repreſent a difficulty in the imagination, reſoluing vvith the vvill to accept it.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. In performing theſe Acts internally a ſoule muſt be very carefull <hi>to exerciſe them with moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility,</hi> &amp; a diſtruſt of her ovvne ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any tentation or contradiction; And vvith an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire truſt and <hi>dependance on Gods grace,</hi> vvith a firme
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48407:342"/> 
                           <hi>faith</hi> in him that he vvill aſſiſt her at all times vvhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he shall bring ſuch tryalls vpon her.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. For this reaſon I haue frequently expreſſed the <hi>Acts of Reſignation</hi> either by vvay of <hi>Oblation &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery</hi> of the ſoule into Gods hands, to be entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by him; Or of <hi>petition</hi> that in all ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences not our ovvne vvill, but Gods vvill should be performed. As for the <hi>Acts</hi> vvhich are made <hi>by way of Reſolution</hi> or purpoſe, though they ſeeme to argue ſome confidence in our ovvne ſtrength, yet the deuout exerciſer ought in his mind to exclude all ſuch confidence.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. The moſt perfect vvay of producing <hi>Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation</hi> (as likevviſe all other Acts) is by <hi>intending pure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>y the loue of God</hi> &amp; ſeeking his glory, renouncing all inferiour vnvvorthy Intereſts of our ovvne. And therfore <hi>Alphonſus</hi> in his <hi>Method of ſeruing God,</hi> in his excellent <hi>Chapter of Prayer,</hi> exhorts all deuout ſoules either expreſſely or vertually to exerciſe Prayer vvith this intention; But as for the <hi>exerciſe of Aſpirations,</hi> an expreſſe &amp; direct intention of Gods glory vvill ſcarce conſiſt vvith it; becauſe that ſublime Exerciſe vvill not admit any <hi>reflected Act</hi> to be mixed; Though implicitely &amp; vertually they containe as much, or more.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. A ſoule needs not allvvaies to oblige herſelfe in her recollections in order to goe through the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vving <hi>Patternes &amp; formes of Reſignation,</hi> according to all the examples giuen, as she vvas aduiſed to doe in other immediate Acts. But she may alter, interrupt,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48407:342"/> omitt or adde others, as she shall ſee cauſe, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her preſent need, or as they shall be interiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſted to her by God, or her ovvne thoughts.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. In the beginning of the exerciſing this degree of Prayer, I conceiue it vvill be the beſt courſe for a ſoule to ſingle out and make choyce of ſuch <hi>Acts of Reſignation</hi> as doe regard ſuch daily <hi>occurring difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> to vvhich nature hath leſſe auerſion to reſigne herſelfe; And from theſe to aſcend aftervvards by degrees to matters of more difficulty, till at laſt by Gods grace she be enabled to accept euen thoſe things from vvhich nature doth moſt abhorre. For if she should ſuddenly aduenture vpon Acts aboue her preſent ſtrength &amp; forces of mind, she vvill be in danger to be deiected, finding that she vvants inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall courage to vndertake or ſubmit to ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties repreſented to her mind.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. And indeed according to this method God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his moſt vviſe and bleſſed Prouidence deales vvith vs, proportioning our trialls and afflictions to our preſent ſtrength, and to the meaſure of grace vvhich he giues vs: ſending to imperfect ſoules only ordinary tentations (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith 1. Cor. 7.) and reſeruing the greater for ſuch heroicall ſpirits as are moſt aduanced in the vvaves of Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. When ſpeciall occaſions of Actuall &amp; reall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation doe not occurre, a ſoule may make gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and indefinite Acts of Reſignation, regarding in groſſe all occaſions vvhatſoeuer vvithout exception: either according to the forme practiſed by <hi>S. Ignatius,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48407:343"/> Deus mens &amp; omnia, Ecce me tibi penitus offero, &amp; omnia mea tuae ſubijcio voluntati.</hi> Or ſaying in our Lords vvords, <hi>Non mea voluntas fiat, ſed tua Domine in terra ſicut in coelo: (Amen Ieſu;)</hi> or in any other forme like to theſe. And this practiſe of <hi>vniuerſall Reſignation</hi> may be begun very timely, &amp; accordingly continued ones whole life, although indeed only perfect ſoules can purely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſeruation exerciſe ſuch acts. Yea vvhen a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſoule hath a particular occaſion to reſigne her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any ſpeciall difficulty occurring, she may for that purpoſe make vſe of any ſuch generall forme of reſignation; only reflecting internally vpon the preſent occaſion, and ſo applying the generall forme, vvithout expreſſely naming the particular difficulty.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. In exerciſing internally theſe Acts, a ſoule is not to produce them <hi>ouer-faſt</hi> &amp; quick one vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to the hurt &amp; oppreſſion of the head or ſpirit; but quietly &amp; leaſurely one after another, vvith reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pauſings.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Though in the follovving <hi>Examples of reſignation</hi> mention is only made of matters difficult &amp; <hi>vnpleaſing to nature;</hi> yet may a ſoule vvith benefit exerciſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the <hi>cleane contrary,</hi> for example; as she may reſigne to <hi>ſicknes, paine, want, dishonour</hi> &amp;c: ſo she may alſo for the glory of God reſigne herſelfe to <hi>health, pleaſures, riches, honour</hi> &amp;c: intending if Gods vvill be ſuch, to accept of theſe alſo, &amp; to employ them only to his glory, &amp; not to the ſatisfaction of corrupt nature; not diminishing but rather increaſinge <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> &amp; <hi>Diuine loue</hi> by them. In vvhich caſe hovv plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48407:343"/> ſoeuer to nature ſuch things in themſelues be, yet the reſignation is exerciſed vvith regard to that vvhich is <hi>mortyfying</hi> to nature. As he that for the glory &amp; loue of God ſubmits himſelfe to accept of <hi>an Office</hi> impoſed on him &amp; attended vvith dignity &amp; povver, intends thereby not the ſatisfying of his ambition, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frames a reſolution to abate &amp; mortify ſuch a ſatisfaction, &amp; to employ that Office (not ſought, but obediently accepted by him) purely to the glory of God &amp; the benefit of ſoules. Thus it is the nature of a ſpirituall life to make good vſe both of proſperity &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity; In all things renouncing all ſelfe-ſeeking, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an eye only to God. Though indeed conſidering our frailty &amp; inclination to be corrupted by proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>aduerſity is far more ſecure</hi> &amp; proffitable for vs; &amp; therfore ſuch reſignations are proper for fevv ſoules.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. To conclude this matter; <hi>Some ſoules</hi> there may be vvhich vvill find it beſt for them to continue in Acts of Reſignation, yea &amp; perhaps euen in <hi>the ſame Acts,</hi> till they be thence brought to Aſpirations. <hi>And others</hi> there vvill be whoſe exerciſes may conſiſt of great variety both of Acts &amp; Affections, &amp; that confuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly both for matter &amp; manner; &amp; this either out of a booke, or from their ovvne Interiour. And in the exerciſing of Acts or Affections, <hi>in ſome</hi> the ſaid Acts may be raiſed by a short reflexion, or by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſome motiues, or euen vvith a precedent ſleight meditation. Laſtly <hi>ſome</hi> vvill find more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in Acts expreſſed <hi>in Latin,</hi> though they doe but imperfectly vnderſtand the language, then in their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48407:344"/> ovvne naturall tongue for vvhoſe ſake I haue in the follovving Collection framed Exerciſes in both lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:) And all theſe manner of exerciſes are good, if the ſoule by experience &amp; obſeruation find proffit by them: for by that alone muſt all our exerciſes be regulated.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. BEEORE I quit this preſent Argument of the <hi>Prayer of forced immediate Acts of the will,</hi> to treate of the ſupreme degree of Prayer, to vvit, <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations;</hi> I conceiue it requiſite to conſider hovv a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout perſon is to behaue himſelfe, vvho hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a Religious Contemplatiue liue in ſolitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and vacancy to attend to God &amp; his holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, but aftervvards coming to find ſome change in that life, either 1. <hi>by being diſtracted</hi> vvith vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoydable Externall Employments and <hi>Offices</hi> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the good of the Community &amp;c. from vvhich
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48407:345"/> all cannot be exempted: 2. <hi>Or elſe</hi> encombred vvith the incommodities &amp; ſollicitudes of <hi>ſicknes,</hi> to vvhich all are obnoxious: (the vvhich are generally <hi>two states</hi> that ſeeme moſt diſaduantageous for retired Prayer:) I ſay, my intention is to giue the beſt aduices I can hovv ſoules are to behaue themſelues in theſe <hi>two ſtates,</hi> as vvith regard to their Prayer eſpecially.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Firſt therfore to the end that a vvell-meaning ſoule may vvith purity behaue herſelfe about <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Offices</hi> &amp; employments: she is to conſider. 1. <hi>That it is vnlawfull,</hi> contrary to humility &amp; a ſigne of a wearines of internall vvayes, and of a ſenſuall deſire to rule ouer others; yea moreouer it is a vvillfull thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ones ſelfe into dangerous diſtractions &amp; tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for any one voluntarily <hi>to deſire</hi> or ſeeke ſuch employments, dignities or Prelatures. 2. <hi>Yet becauſe</hi> it is neceſſary that ſome should be employed in offices that regard the common good, ſpirituall or temporall; <hi>it is as vnlawfull</hi> vtterly to <hi>refuſe</hi> them, vvhenſoeuer God shall by the command of Superiours call a ſoule to the vndertaking &amp; diſcharge of ſuch <hi>Offices.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. For this reaſon it vvill behooue euery Religious deuout ſoule by aſſiduous <hi>Prayer,</hi> during the time of vacancy, to furnish herſelfe vvith light &amp; diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that she may proceede in this matter vvith the ſpirit of humility, prudence and Religious Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In caſe therfore that <hi>Superiours</hi> shall thinke good to impoſe an office vpon a Religious ſubiect; 1. <hi>If the ſubiect</hi> knovv of any reall incapacity or diſability in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48407:345"/> himſelfe, or if he beleiue any other more ſufficiently qualified, he ought vvith all humility &amp; ſimplicity to rectify the Superiours miſtaken opinion concerning his ſufficiency; yea he may repreſent vnto him his iuſt grounds of feare, leaſt ſuch an Employment should proue notably preiudiciall to his ſoule; Proteſting likevviſe that he does not deſire any kind of preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ouer others &amp;c: 2. <hi>Yet if the Superiour,</hi> notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch humble &amp; ſincere Remonſtrances of the <hi>Subiect,</hi> shall perſiſt in a reſolution to impoſe on him any ſuch office, (vvhatſoeuer the Superiours <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> be, vvhether neceſſity, Reaſon, or euen Paſſion:) the <hi>Subiect</hi> muſt ſubmit himſelfe, &amp; <hi>accept</hi> of it vvilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vvhatſoeuer reluctance there be in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or nature againſt it. But let him accept it vvith <hi>a pure Intention</hi> for God in the ſpirit of obedience; Eſpecially if the office be gratefull to nature or to the ſenſuall or ambitious deſires of it. 3. <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> conſidering his ovvne frailty &amp; the tentations likely to accompany ſuch an employment, he ought to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it vvith ſome feare &amp; apprehenſion, leaſt vvithout extraordinary vvatchfullnes in Prayer, he may come to be corrupted or oppreſſed by it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In this regard therfore the ſubiect ought often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>to renew</hi> &amp; rectify <hi>his Intention</hi> about it, at leaſt in his <hi>recollections</hi> twice a day. For, for vvant of care in this poynt it oft falls out, that the Office vvhich at firſt vvas vndertaken out of obedience to God &amp; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, comes aftervvard to be executed for ſelfe-vvill &amp; ſenſuall complacence, after that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48407:346"/> of deuotion is abated or extinguished.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Indeed <hi>ſo contrary</hi> &amp; preiudiciall to the ſpirit of Contemplatiue Prayer are the diſtractions &amp; ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes vvhich attend <hi>Offices,</hi> that. 1. <hi>Religious ſubiects</hi> during the time of vacancy vvhen they are more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, ought to forethinke &amp; imprint in their hearts good purpoſes neuer to offer themſelues to ſuch dangers; &amp; vvhen they shall befall them, to carry themſelues in them vigilantly &amp; prudently, according to their former light; leaſt entring vpon them vnprouided, they should proue miſcheiuous &amp; deſtructiue to all deuotion. 2. <hi>And againe Superiours,</hi> if they vvill conſider that their principall care ought to be for the good of ſoules, vvill thinke it concernes them to be very nice in expoſing to ſuch perills their ſubiects, before that the ſpirit of deuotion &amp; charity be firmly rooted in their hearts: for they alſo shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the harme that their ſubiects ſoules shall ſo incurre.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Some <hi>Superiours</hi> either being of <hi>Actiue ſpirits,</hi> &amp; not knovving or not duly eſteeming Internall vvayes; Or perhaps miſtakingly beleiuing their ſubiects to be more affected to externall Employments then inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, thereupon vnvvarily heape on them buſineſſes to the hindrance of their recollections. In this caſe the <hi>Subiect</hi> ought to acquaint his Superiour vvith the invvard diſpoſition of his ſoule: hovv much good he finds by a conſtant Exerciſe of Prayer; &amp; vvhat dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage the vvant of it cauſeth to his imperfect ſoule: but this being done, he muſt reſolue to ſubmit, in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48407:346"/> caſe his ſuperiour ſtill thinke fit to employ him.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In ſuch circumſtances let not the ſubiect be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled if he find it hard to abſtaine from shevving ſome outvvard markes of vnvvillingnes, hovveuer in his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour vvill he be reſigned. For indeed to shevv <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes</hi> argues in an imperfect ſoule rather a contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be diſpenced from prayer, not ſufficiently eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him, then a loue to obedience. Yea ſuch <hi>a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnwillingnes</hi> vvill afford him <hi>a double mortification.</hi> 1. <hi>In that he contradicts</hi> ſenſuality in the diſcharge of obedience. 2. <hi>In that he incurres</hi> in the opinion of others an eſteeme of being immortified, the vvhich vvill be a meanes to humble him.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. When an Internall liuer is once actually &amp; duly engaged in an office, <hi>In the first place</hi> he ought ſeriouſly to conſider that coming out of a ſtate of Abſtraction &amp; ſolitude into buſines, he vvill thenceforvvard vvalke in leſſe light then formerly, &amp; yet vvill be expoſed to far greater perills, by reaſon of many vnauoydable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of diſtraction, Impatience, ſatisfaction of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality &amp;c: of vvhich he had little experience in time paſt. Therfore he muſt reſolue to keepe a more <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full guard</hi> ouer himſelfe; leaſt buſines bring him to a forgetfullnes of his ſoule, &amp; of all former Inſtructions &amp; good purpoſes.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to the end to ſecure himſelfe from ſuch perills, he muſt in the <hi>Actuall execution</hi> of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be vvary that he doe not fixe his mind more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently &amp; affectionatly on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then meere neceſſity shall require. Let him oft call to mind his former good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48407:347"/> &amp; reuiew againe &amp; againe theſe or the like Inſtructions. For vvithout ſuch preuentions it can ſcarce be auoyded but that he vvill decay in ſpirit, &amp; grovv negligently <hi>tepide</hi> in his ſpirituall Exerciſes; ſince corrupt nature vvill be very forvvard to take any colourable pretences of quitting Internall Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (the only ſupport of a ſpirituall life:) the vvhich novv vvill become more irkeſome by reaſon of greater diſſipation of thoughts, &amp; more frequent occaſions of falling into immortifications. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſoules vvill be apt to thinke that the nature of their preſent Employments is ſuch, as that they vvill not conſiſt vvith the obligations of an Internall life; Then they vvill catch hold of any aduantage to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence vvith them, for that pupoſe making vſe of ſuch popular ſayings as this, <hi>That euery good worke is a Prayer &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> more particularly in this ſtate of Actiue employments a ſoule muſt be carefull, as far as the <hi>Office</hi> vvill permit, not only to continue the practiſe of her former mortifications (&amp; principally for the tongue &amp; ſenſes:) but alſo to make good vſe of thoſe many nevv mortifications, vvhich the diſcharge of her employment vvill afford her occaſions to exerciſe. And indeed, ſince probably she cannot enioy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſpirit requiſite to ſerious &amp; perfect Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, she ought the beſt she can to recompence that defect by increaſing the practiſe of Mortification and patience; by vvhich meanes she vvill aduance herſelfe in ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="12">

                              </gap>y</hi> she muſt remember that <hi>the doctrine of Abstraction</hi> (moſt neceſſary in an internall life) has place alſo euen in diſtractiue Offices; at leaſt thus far, that the perſon is not to meddle in things that belong not to his preſent Employment; And for ſuch things as doe belong therto; he muſt be carefull, as to doe them vvell &amp; faithfully, ſo vvithout beſtovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them more ſollicitude then shall neceſſarily be required; performing them ſeriouſly, but yet vvith compoſednes and tranquillity of mind; not ſuffring them to diſtract or encomber his memory before the time come for the executing of them; And then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from paſſion &amp; impetuouſnes, &amp; from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging his affections to them. A deuout ſoule thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſcharging her Office, vvill come to that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eaſines and ſetlednes of ſpirit, that neceſſary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments vvill breed in her no harmfull diſtractions; (the cauſe of vvhich is inordinate loue to creatures.)</p>
                        <p n="13">13. But <hi>Fifthly &amp; laſtly, her principall care must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Prayer;</hi> Although by occaſion of buſines she cannot ſo habitually continue in a recollected ſtate, yet at leaſt ſhe muſt reſolue diligently &amp; faithfully to purſue her <hi>daily appointed Exerciſes;</hi> ſince <hi>prayer is the principall inſtrument by which diuine light &amp; grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all tentations is adminiſtred to vs.</hi> So that if <hi>Praier</hi> be duly performed, be it vvith diſtractions or without them, it vvill both vrge a ſoule to vſe fitting Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of Praier, and to make aduantage (tovvard the perfectionating and aduancing of her ſpirit) euen of the diſtractions &amp; encombrances of her <hi>Office.</hi>
                           <pb n="182" facs="tcp:48407:348"/> Wheras if she be careles in Prayer, she vvill become careles alſo in Mortification; And by little and little vvill looſe all that vvhich vvith great paine &amp; trauaile she had formerly gotten, yea &amp; be in very great perill neuer to find a vvay to returne to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Certainly if any diſtractions or employments can iuſtify a ſoule for the neglect of this duty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Prayer, thoſe vvhich attend the <hi>Popedome</hi> (the higheſt vveightieſt and moſt inceſſantly encombring <hi>Office</hi> that a ſoule is capable of) may doe it.

                        <p n="15">15. Herevpon <hi>Granatenſis</hi> vvill allovv of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, vnder pretence of buſines, to ceaſe from purſuing daily Recollections. For (ſaith he) no buſines can be ſo neceſſary &amp; ſo continually vrgent as to hinder our daily neceſſary <hi>Refections.</hi> Novv <hi>Prayer (which is the foode of the ſoule)</hi> is as neceſſary, if not more, then that of the <hi>Body.</hi> And if it ſo fall out, that buſineſſes are to be diſpatched iuſt at the houres appointed for daily <hi>Spirituall Refections,</hi> the perſon foreſeeing that, ought to repaire himſelfe by taking ſome other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant time for his Prayer. And if that vvill not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, he may &amp; ought according to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Aquauiua Generall of the Ieſuits,</hi> to ſollicite his

                           <hi>Superiours</hi> to giue him ſome relaxation from ſuch employments: Which the Superiour is obliged to grant, othervviſe God vvill require a ſeuere account from him for the harme that muſt needs come to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſoule by the vvant of that vvhich is only able to ſupport the ſpirit, &amp; to enable it vvith proffit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the moſt neceſſary dutyes of his calling.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. If either out of ſloth, diſtractions or remorſe through ſome imperfections incurred a ſoule find difficulty to apply herſelfe any time to prayer, though she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe better for the future; yet if vpon any motiues of ſenſuall nature she omit it at any time, she vvill the day follovving haue leſſe mind to goe to it; &amp; ſo be in danger quite to abandon her recollections. If she haue not the very ſame excuſes &amp; pretences that she had formerly, Nature vvill be ſubtle enough to inuent ſome other; for the longer she delayes, the more vnapt vvill she be for it; according to that vviſe ſaying of the <hi>Ancient Rabbins, Qui protrudit horam, hora protrudet ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> that is, <hi>He that thruſts of the houre of doing any good duty till another time; that houre when it comes will thrust of &amp; delay him;</hi> he vvill be leſſe capable then of doing his duty, then he vvas formerly by meanes of ſome nevv impediment. Whereas a ſoule by vſing ſome violence vpon herſelfe to breake through diſcouragements to prayer, vvill get ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage &amp; grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, that aftervvards her employments vvill afford her leſſe hindrance vnto this holy duty.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. To this purpoſe <hi>Iohannes a Ieſu Maria Generall of the diſcalced Carmelites</hi> relates concerning a deuout
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48407:349"/> 
                           <hi>Gentleman</hi> a Penitent of his, vvho dayly vſed at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time to recollect himſelfe in prayer: hovv that treating vvith another vpon ſome affaires of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, &amp; the clock hapning to ſtrike the houre appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his prayer; he abruptly broke of the conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, excuſing himſelfe, that he had then an affaire of ſuch importance that it could not be delayed, &amp; muſt not be omitted; And ſo diſmiſſing his freind, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his recollection; vvherein God vvas pleaſed, as in revvard for his diligence &amp; fidelity to him, to viſit him after an extraordinary manner vvith ſome kind of ſupernaturall Contemplation, ſuch as he had neuer had experience of before.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. A vvell-minded ſoule therfore, to the end she may be enabled to attend to this <hi>buſines of buſineſſes</hi> (as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> calls it) ought to employ all her proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; ſubtilty ſo to order all her dayly employments both for time &amp; manner, as that they may be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance thereto. Let her, if need be, make notes &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of her ſeuerall affaires each day (to the end her memory may not betray her:) &amp; beginning the morning vvith a ſerious recollection (vvhich vvill ſanctify all the follovving dayes vvorke) let her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to diſpatch her taske vvith ſuch care &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that tovvards euening she may be before-hand vvith her taske of buſineſſes, that ſollicitudes about them may not diſquiet her mind, encomber her memory, nor diſtract her Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. It is morally impoſſible that in a religious ſtate there should be any Employment that should ſo
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48407:349"/> vvholly (&amp; this conſtantly) take vp ones thoughts, as not to leaue one houre each day to be giuen to God. Or if ſuch an employment vvere, it vvould be <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely vnlawfull,</hi> as being deſtructiue to the obligation of a Chriſtian, and much more that of a ſpirituall or Religious perſon. <hi>No excuſe</hi> therfore or pretence can iuſtify a cuſtomary neglect of ſo eſſentiall a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. In caſe that ſometimes by reaſon of ſome preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing affaires the deuout ſoule cannot allovv herſelfe the vvhole time appoynted for her Recollections; let her at leaſt take as much of it as poſſibly may be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Or let her in exchange take ſome other houre of the day, or night. Hovveuer let her preſerue a thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire and loue to Prayer, and by feruent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Actuations (as the preſent buſines vvill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) &amp; by ſome more then ordinary Mortifications (eſpecially of the tongue) repaire the loſſe of a ſett Recollection.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. If a ſoule in Employments cannot free her mind from diſtractions, Aridities and ſollicitudes in Prayer: let her hovveuer be courageous to purſue it after the beſt manner she can; preſeruing as much Reſignation &amp; tranquillity (at leaſt in the Superiour ſoule) as may be. And let the ſight of ſuch imperfections humble, but not diſquiet her ſpirit. Let her conſider &amp; beleiue that God is not only as preſent to her in her ſpirit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her greateſt deſolations, as he vvas in her cleareſt Recollections, but as louing alſo; And that this is the proper ſeaſon for a ſoule to shevv her fidelity to God,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48407:350"/> in adhering to him in the top of her ſpirit, vvhen as not only the <hi>Interiour ſenſes</hi> are diuerted by images of buſineſſes, but the <hi>Affections</hi> alſo diſordered by ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. To this purpoſe she may apply <hi>the Point of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> mentioned by <hi>fa: Benet Canfeild,</hi> vvho to the great comfort of vvell-meaning ſoules, shevves, <hi>That in the midſt of the greateſt troubles, Afflictions, Paſsions &amp; diſtractions a ſoule may as truly &amp; efficaciouſly diſpoſe of the operations of the Superiour ſpirit (which depends not vpon our corporall organs) fixing them vpon God, making choyce of him for her finall end, and ſubmitting herſelfe with reſignation &amp; loue to him euen for ſending her ſuch trial's, as she could in her greateſt ſolitude &amp; moſt quiet Introuerſion.</hi> And this is beſt done vvithout any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or impetuoſity, but vvith great tranquillity dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſpirituall regard to God, by meanes of vvhich she may be as truly &amp; effectually vnited to God (though not according to ſenſe) in the midſt of theſe troubles, as in her greateſt ſenſible vnions.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. A ſoule that vvill be thus vigilant &amp; induſtrious may aſſure herſelfe, that God vvho layes this <hi>Office</hi> on her, doth it not for her harme, but for her greater good, &amp; to giue her occaſion of exerciſing ſeuerall vertues, vvhich othervviſe she vvould haue vvanted, (at leaſt the perfection of them:) as likevviſe for the triall of her fidelity to him amidſt vvhatſoeuer encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances &amp; tentations. Novv by meanes of theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues she vvill make a great progreſſe in ſpirit, at leaſt for as much as concernes ſolide Charity, if not for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48407:350"/> light of contemplation; And retaining a loue to Prayer, &amp; practiſing it as vvell as she can, she vvill come to be in ſo good a diſpoſition, that vvhen she thall returne to her former vacancy &amp; ſolitude, she vvill make a a vvonderfull progreſſe in the vvayes of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Thus she may ſee, that as the <hi>Office</hi> hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rills in it; ſo vvill God proportionably increaſe his grace &amp; aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. For vvant of this care &amp; vigilance ouer their interiour, it is to be feared there be many in <hi>Religious Conuents</hi> that fruitleſly ſpend their liues in Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſome ſort beneficiall to others, but of little proffit, yea perhaps very preiudiciall to themſelues; as ſome that read <hi>Leſsons</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Diuinity,</hi> yea euen many that paſſe their vvhole time almoſt in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Employments, as <hi>preaching, hearing Confeſsions, giuing Spirituall Directions</hi> &amp;c: for theſe vvorkes being performed not in vertue of <hi>Spirituall Praier,</hi> &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not proceeding from the Diuine ſpirit, but the ſpirit of corrupt nature (vvhich is the ſource of all actions performed in a ſtate of Diſtraction) Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſeldome giues a bleſſing to them.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE <hi>ſecond state</hi> (before mentioned) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a more then ordinary care and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as ſeeming leſſe proper for internall exerciſes) is the ſtate of <hi>Sicknes;</hi> The vvhich though it doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a greater ſollicitude &amp; vigilance, as being a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a condition <hi>ireuerſible;</hi> yet in it ſelfe it is <hi>a more ſecure ſtate</hi> then that of externall Employments; In as much as thoſe are ſuch as are apt to dravv our affections from God to ſenſuall obiects; vvheras in Sicknes all things doe rather driue a ſoule to ſeeke &amp; adhere vnto God, ſince all other comforts doe faile her, and all pleaſures become diſtaſtfull to her. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer in Sicknes there are continuall occaſions of high Reſignations, and far leſſe ſollicitudes about temporall matters; for the cheife buſines of a ſicke Perſon is <hi>forbearing</hi> &amp; <hi>holding of patience;</hi> In a vvord, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>a Not-doing</hi> then <hi>doing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now ſince it concernes a ſoule moſt deeply to be vvell-diſpoſed in ſicknes; My purpoſe is to giue ſome <hi>generall Aduices</hi> to ſoules already practiſed in internall vvayes; &amp; they shall be ſuch as cheifly haue a reference to <hi>Prayer</hi> &amp; <hi>Mortification;</hi> The vvhich Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices notvvithſtanding our ſicke perſon ought only ſo far to make vſe of, as he finds them proper for his ſpirit &amp; caſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="190" facs="tcp:48407:352"/>3. It vvas not vvithout iuſt reaſon that an <hi>Ancient holy man</hi> ſaid, that <hi>a Religious ſpirituall life is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall meditation of death:</hi> becauſe the principall end of all our exerciſes is to prepare our ſelues againſt the day of our great account, to the end <hi>wee may giue it with ioy, &amp; not with feare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. If when ſicknes is come, a ſoule be to learne hovv she ought to behaue herſelfe, it vvill goe hard vvith her, by reaſon that then ſuch a ſoule vvill be in great blindnes of vnderſtanding, and deadnes of will: All her thoughts and care vvill be employed in ſeeking to auoyd paine, to paſſe away the tedious time, and to recouer; And if any good thoughts come into her mind, it is <hi>Feare</hi> that principally raiſes them. Hence it is that <hi>a ſerious conuerſion is ſeldome giuen in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> vvhen Paſſions doe ſvvell, &amp; immortifications come thick vpon one another; And a ſoule that in health hath neglected God &amp; deſpiſed the meanes of Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot vvith any reaſon or confidence expect an extraordinary or miraculous Grace to vvorke a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cordiall Conuerſion. If that ones vvhole life ſpent in painfull mortifications &amp; ſerious recollections be but euen little enough to conquer the peruerſenes of our vvills, &amp; the glevvynes of our Affections adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſenſuall obiects; vvhat may be expected from a fevv interrupted inefficacious Prayers or purpoſes in ſicknes, ſuggeſted meerly by feare vpon the approches of death &amp; Iudgment, vvhilſt there ſtill remaines in the heart a ſecret loue to thoſe ſinfull delights that muſt novv be forſaken? Vpon vvhich grounds <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
                           <pb n="191" facs="tcp:48407:352"/> hath a terrible ſaying; That <hi>among thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their Conuerſion till their death, ſcarce one of a hundred thouſand are ſaued.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. And I beleiue the caſe of ſuch a ſoule <hi>in Religion</hi> is more perillous, becauſe hauing enioyed ſo great helpes to a holy life, she has vvith ſo vnpardonable an ingratitude neglected them. Wheras <hi>a ſecular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> being touched in ſicknes, may reſolue to ſecke thoſe meanes of abſtraction of life, a renouncing of the vvorld, Prayer &amp;c: the vvant of vvhich vvas the principall cauſe (it may be) of his deordinations. Vpon vvhich grounds alone <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he would giue abſolution preſently to the greateſt ſinner (in ſicknes,) if he would promiſe (vpon ſuppoſition of recouery) to quit the world, and embrace a Penitentiall life in Religion.</hi> Becauſe it is not poſſible to promiſe or performe a greater ſatisfaction. But I doubt vvhether he vvould be ſo indulgent to an vnconuerted Religious perſon, that can promiſe no higher ſtate then he is in allready vvith ſo little good effect to his ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Yet God forbid that from hence any should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly giue vvay to deſpaire, or deliberately refuſe to humble themſelues, to mortify their inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or to pray the beſt they can. Good purpoſes &amp; actions performed meerly out of feare vvill produce ſome good effect; &amp; Gods goodnes (vvhich is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible) may change feare into loue, hovv imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſoeuer.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Novv though the caſe of <hi>tepide liuers</hi> be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo miſerable; yet it is infinitely perillous, &amp;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48407:353"/> the iſſue extremely to be ſuſpected. For though they cannot be charged vvith many great ſins of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet their vvhole life has bene <hi>a continuall omiſſion</hi> of duties to vvhich their Profeſſion did in a ſpeciall manner oblige them. And novv vvhat other <hi>new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> can they haue to relinquish their negligence but only <hi>feare</hi> alſo? Or vvhat <hi>Prayers</hi> are they likely to make, vvhen their neceſſity is ſo great, &amp; the helpes to Prayer ſo ſmall?</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The only ſecure vvay therfore to preuent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring this hazardous ſtate in ſicknes, is during health to combat againſt Tepidity, and by diligent Prayer to prouide ones ſelfe of Internall ſtrength &amp; Grace. For ſuch ſoules by a proſecution of their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Duties of mortification &amp; Prayer make good vſe of their <hi>ſicknes</hi> &amp; <hi>gaine extremely by it.</hi> They are not forvvard to promiſe great matters (as tepide ſoules vſually doe, though they performe but little:) They haue forethought of ſicknes, &amp; the tentations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it; &amp; novv call to mind &amp; execute for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſolutions made to improoue, for their ſoules ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, all ſtates &amp; conditions; &amp; by occaſion of their preſent corporall Infirmity or paines to fortify in their minds the vertue of <hi>Patience, Reſignation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world</hi> &amp; <hi>adheſion to God.</hi> Thus <hi>Sicknes</hi> proues to them a greater bleſſing then health. And if they doe recouer, they doe yet more ſeriouſly &amp; feruorouſly performe their former exerciſes.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. When <hi>Sicknes</hi> is actually come, a ſoule is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept &amp; embrace it, as a ſpeciall <hi>gift of God;</hi> yea though
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48407:353"/> ſuch ſicknes hapned through the perſons ovvne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance or other fault; As a <hi>Malefactour</hi> is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vvith reſignation to accept of death deſerued for ſome crime. He ought indeed to be penitent &amp; ſorry for the <hi>faults</hi> vvhich vvere the cauſe of ſuch an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effect; but the <hi>effect it ſelfe</hi> he ought to conſider as proceeding from the Diuine Will and Prouidence. Yea in ſuch caſes, a ſoule may euen reioyce that God is ſo mercifull as to bring on her the ſmart and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of her ſins in this vvorld; giuing her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a proffitable occaſion to exerciſe her reſignation; from vvhence she may inferre a hope that he vvill therfore ſpare her after this life.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. A ſoule muſt not forbeare this <hi>willing accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Sicknes</hi> &amp;c. becauſe perhaps she finds great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance therto in ſenſuality; yea she ought therfore the rather to accept it, as knowing that it is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour vvill, &amp; not the vvill of ſenſuality that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth or demeriteth. And ſo doing the repugnance of ſenſuality vvill, as vvell as the ſicknes, turne to the merit &amp; aduancement of the ſoule.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Novv a ſoule muſt not content herſelfe for once or tvvice to accept ſicknes; but she muſt practiſe this almoſt continually; and eſpecially vvhen any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary paine or irkeſomenes does afflict her. And ſuch acceptation muſt be not only for the preſent, but vvith a mind vvillingly to ſubmit to the Diuine vvill, if his pleaſure vvere that ſuch paines should continue neuer ſo long.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. She muſt particularly take heed of <hi>one notable
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48407:354"/> tentation,</hi> vvhich often befalls good, but imperfect ſoules, by meanes of vvhich they yeild too freely to impatience in <hi>Sicknes; Which is this; Nature</hi> being ſoone vveary of ſuffring, vvill ſuggeſt vnto the ſoule, to iuſtify impatience, among other incommodities of ſicknes this one, that thereby she is put in an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to pray, or othervviſe to ſerue God or her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; vpon vvhich she vvill be apt to deſire health vvith impatience; falſely iuſtifying herſelfe for ſuch impatience, as if she did not ſo for the ſatisfaction of nature, but to the end she may performe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties more perfectly. But this is a meere <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> For <hi>that is the true &amp; perfect way of ſeruing God, which is ſuitable to the preſent Condition wherein God hath placed a ſoule;</hi> &amp; an imperfect interrupted Prayer made vvith reſignation in the midſt of paines or troubles ſent by God, is perhaps more efficacious to procure the good of the ſoule, then the higheſt eleuations exerciſed othervviſe.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. It is no great matter though the ſoule herſelfe doe not diſtinctly &amp; clearely ſee hovv her preſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings (externall or Internall) may be proffitable to her; she is to referre all things to the infinite Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; goodnes of God, <hi>who can bring light out of darkenes.</hi> And therfore she muſt be contented (if ſuch be his vvill) to be blind-folded, &amp; humbly to remaine in her ſimplicity, &amp; in a reuerentiall avve &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the inſcrutable vvaies of the Diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. A <hi>ſicke perſon</hi> is to account himſelfe after an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48407:354"/> manner in Gods hands, as his <hi>Priſoner,</hi> chained, as it vvere, by his ovvne vveakenes; diſabled from the ordinary ſolaces of conuerſation, vvalking &amp;c: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from eating vvhat pleaſes the Palate: become proffitable to none; troubleſome &amp; chargeable to many; expoſed oftimes to bitter paines, &amp; sharper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of ſuch paines &amp;c: A greiuous indeed but yet <hi>a happy priſon</hi> this is to a ſoule that vvill make a good vſe of it: For vnleſſe the internall taſt of the ſoule alſo be depraued, she may by this occaſion infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſpirituall liberty, health &amp; ſtrength, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting vvith indifference theſe incommodities, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying her naturall exorbitant deſire of remedies; not deſiring to eſcape, but vvhen &amp; after vvhat manner God shall ordaine.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. But to ſpeake more particularly touching <hi>the Duties of a ſoule during ſicknes;</hi> She is to aſſure herſelfe of this one thing; <hi>That</hi> if she thinke that her <hi>Sicknes</hi> may iuſtify her neglect of her <hi>ſpirituall Exerciſes of mortification &amp; Prayer</hi> (the eſſentiall Duties of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life:) if theſe be not continued as vvell in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as health, <hi>the ſoule</hi> herſelfe vvill become the more ſicke of the tvvo, &amp; expoſed to greater danger then <hi>the body.</hi> For moſt certainly, if ſicknes doe not produce good effects of patience &amp; reſignation &amp;c: in the ſoule, it vvill produce the quite contrary. And ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects cannot be produced, but only by the exerciſe of mortification &amp; prayer.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. <hi>Firſt therfore for Mortification,</hi> this is indeed the proper time vvherein it is moſt ſeaſonable &amp; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48407:355"/> Store of matter for that vertue is almoſt inceſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly afforded, <hi>Paines, weakenes &amp;c: in the body;</hi> &amp; <hi>greife, feare</hi> &amp; other diſquieting paſſions in the mind, vvhich are oft more inſupportable then outvvard torments: all theſe tentations the ſoule muſt be armed againſt.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Now among all <hi>Internall tentations</hi> the greateſt &amp; moſt painfull is <hi>Feare of death,</hi> &amp; eſpecially of the conſequents of it, <hi>Iudgment</hi> &amp; <hi>hell;</hi> without vvhich, <hi>death</hi> to a faithfull Chriſtian could not rationally be the Obiect of feare, as he that knovves it to be the vniuerſall inheritance of mankind, &amp; to Chriſtians <hi>the Dore of eternall happines.</hi> In caſe therfore that ſuch feare of death doe remaine in Inferiour nature, the Superiour Reaſon ought to contradict it, &amp; vſe it as a ſubiect of a very healthfull Mortification.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. But as for the other far more conſiderable, more invvard &amp; painfull ſubiect of <hi>feare,</hi> vvhich is the <hi>Vncertainty of a future Eternall condition after death,</hi> the vvhich doth vſually much afflict &amp; deiect imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſoules, that are conſcious of their manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſmall ſatisfaction paid for them, great vveak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Diuine loue (a proofe vvhereof is this verie feare, vvhich vvould be expelled if Charity vvere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;) It is a hard matter to encourage ſuch ſoules againſt it, or to perſvvade them to mortify it, and reſigne themſelues vvillingly to ſupport it, it being indeed very proffitable &amp; healthfull to the ſoule. On the contrary they thinke Reſignation in this caſe to be ſcarce a fitting or lavvfull thing; though moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is ſo.</p>
                        <p n="19">
                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:48407:355"/>19. I doe not ſay that ſuch ſoules ought to bring themſelues to an <hi>Indifference</hi> vvhat vvay they shall be diſpoſed of after death. But <hi>the Point of Reſignation</hi> lies in this; that a ſoule ought to content herſelfe not to knovv hovv &amp; in what manner God vvill diſpoſe of her after death. Her <hi>Anchor is hope;</hi> vvhich she ought to cherish and fortify all she can. And the beſt way for ſoules to fortify that, is to make as <hi>few reflexions</hi> on themſelues as may be, and to employ all their thoughts and affections directly vpon God. It is <hi>Diuine loue</hi> alone that is at leaſt the principall vertue that brings ſoules to <hi>Beatitude;</hi> and therfore fearfull ſoules though they vvere in as dangerous a ſtate as they ſuſpect, muſt needs rationally argue thus, <hi>That the way</hi> to procure &amp; ſtrengthen loue is by fixing their minds vpon the Mercies, Goodnes &amp; Perfections of God, &amp; to contradict or forget all arguments or motiues of ſeruile <hi>Feare, the greatest enemy of Loue.</hi> What folly is it, becauſe they are imperfect, therfore vvillfully to continue in their imperfections by nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing feare? Surely at the <hi>cloſe of our liues</hi> vvee ought to practiſe after the beſt manner vvee can the beſt Actions, and moſt acceptable to God, vvhich is to relinquish our ſelues, and to contemplate, truſt, rely &amp; role our ſelues vpon him.</p>

Next touching the <hi>Mortification and moderation of the ſenſuall appetite</hi> to be practiſed in <hi>Sicknes;</hi> In the <hi>first place</hi> it cannot be denied, but that it is lavvfull &amp; fitting for a ſicke Perſon to deſire &amp; ſeeke <hi>remedies</hi> proper in that caſe. Yet this is to be done vvithout too much ſollicitude &amp; diſquietnes of mind; And in caſe ſuch <hi>Remedies</hi> cannot be had, a contented ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of mind in the vvant or refuſall of them is of admirable vertue to aduance the ſoule; ſince neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty declares ſuch a vvant to be the vvill of God, and this for the ſoules greater good.

                        <p n="1">1. INTERNALL Prayer ſeriouſly proſecuted (as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues to be) being contrary to our naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, cannot chuſe but cauſe ſome trouble &amp; vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines to nature, &amp; abate the vigorouſnes of the body, quenching thoſe ſpirits, &amp; drayning thoſe humours vvhich are ſuperfluous, &amp; afford matter of tentations. Yet on the other ſide, it makes amends euen to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, in contributing much to the prolonging of life, by meanes of moderation of Dyet, a compoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Paſſions &amp; contentation of mind &amp;c: vvhich it cauſeth. <hi>Proofes</hi> vvhereof vvee haue in the <hi>Ancient holy Fathers of the deſert</hi> &amp; more lately in <hi>S.

                        <p n="2">2. Hovveuer if it vvere othervviſe, the ſoule is not to ſerue the body, but the body the ſoule; ſo that if one of them muſt for the benefit of the other be a looſer, it is moſt iuſt that the loſſe should lye on the bodies ſide. And ſurely ſince there is ſcarce any ſtudy or exerciſe of mind vvhich does not abridge life or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate the functions of it, vvithout making any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to the ſoule for the future life; &amp; yet for all that men neither are diſcouraged, nor doe thinke it fit for ſuch conſiderations to forbeare ſuch ſtudies; much leſſe certainly ought ſpirituall &amp; Diuine exerciſes be laid aſide vpon ſuch pretences.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Notvvithſtanding iuſt it is that ſome due regard be had to the <hi>body,</hi> that it be not too much preiudiced by the exerciſes of the ſpirit performed, vvith ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much violence &amp; impetuoſity, And this not ſo much for the bodies ſake, as the ſpirits; the vvhich ſince in this life it cannot worke vvithout the body, by too violent vvorkings it may ſo weaken the body as that it vvill not be enabled for continuance; &amp; ſo thoſe little short gaines vvhich are gott by a few impetuous Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, vvill be dearly bought by an incapacity of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing them, contracted in both ſoule &amp; body. Wee muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtretch our vnderſtandings to high ſeekings, leaſt vvee be plunged thereby in Internall darkenes, from vvhich vvould proceede intolerable perplexities: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt vvee force the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s euen to good obiects

                        <p n="4">4. As for the painfullnes, troubles &amp; vneaſines to nature that vvithout too much debility doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſpirituall exerciſes, thoſe may vvell enough be digeſted, conſidering the vnſpeakable benefits &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that they produce vnto the ſoule. And yet for our comfort this vneaſines vvill by cuſtome &amp; conſtancy continually diminish; for as <hi>Harphius</hi> obſerues, a ſoule after long practiſe of Eleuations of ſpirit, vvill come to ſuch a facility in them, that they vvilll become as it vvere naturall to her. And herein vvee may obſerue the vvonderfull vviſedome &amp; goodnes of the diuine Prouidence ouer ſoules, hovv he tempers the exerciſes of the ſpirit to the Exigence of the body; For vvhile the body being vigorous, is able to endure more, he giues her ruder &amp; more laborious exerciſes; But vvhen by long-continued vvorkings, it is become ſo feeble that any violent Intention of the ſpirit, or rude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall mortifications (of vvhich there is no need) vvould ouer-vvhelme it, then the exerciſes are moſt eaſy, peaceable, ſilent &amp; ſerene, yet infinitely more full of vertue then formerly.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Novv the peculiar vertue by vvhich all harmfull inconueniences either to the body or ſpirit may be auoyded is that <hi>ſupernaturall Diſcretion,</hi> by vvhich a ſoule is enabled to hold a Meane, &amp; auoyde the vicious Extremes, in the practiſing of all ſpirituall duties. It is iuſtly called a <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> vertue, becauſe God only

                        <p n="8">8. Novv <hi>Superiours</hi> ought rarely to impoſe ſuch kind of Mortifications on their ſubiects; becauſe ſo many circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are required to make them vvell impoſed,

                        <p n="4">4.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48407:370"/> exerciſe of a ſilent Recollection; determining to performe it purely for Gods glory, renouncing all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour priuate Intereſts &amp; contentments &amp;c: 4. <hi>She may</hi> (if need be) meditate a little vpon one of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> concerning the <hi>Incarnation &amp; Paſsion</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>our Lord:</hi> alſo mixing certaine <hi>Eiaculatory Prayers.</hi> 5. <hi>She is to make</hi> a firme <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> &amp; acknovvledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Gods Preſence</hi> in the center of the ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvhom she intends to place herſelfe vvith moſt profound Reuerence, humility &amp; loue.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>In conſequence</hi> to theſe <hi>Preparations</hi> (in the vvhich she is to continue till she find herſelfe diſpoſed to quitt all ſuch expreſſe &amp; direct Acts or affections, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an implicite aſſurance by a bare &amp; <hi>obſcure faith</hi> that God, vvho is incomprehenſible vniuerſall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is indeed preſent to &amp; in her:) All that remaines for her then to doe is, vvith all humility &amp; loue to continue in his preſence in the quality of <hi>a Petitioner,</hi> but ſuch an one as makes no ſpeciall direct Requeſts, but contents herſelfe to appeare before him vvith all her vvants &amp; neceſſities, beſt, &amp; indeed only, knovvn to <hi>him, Who</hi> therfore needes not her information. So that she vvith a ſilent attention regards God only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting all manner of images of all obiects vvhatſoeuer; &amp; vvith <hi>the Will</hi> she frames no particular requeſts nor any expreſſe <hi>Acts</hi> tovvards God, but remaines in an entire ſilence both of tongue &amp; thoughts, (the vertue of the precedent direct Acts remaining in her:) vvith a ſvveere tacite conſent of Loue in the vvill permitting God to take an entire poſſeſſion of

Novv the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> that he shevves him is not by making any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe reflexions or invvard ſaying, <hi>The King is here, to whom I owe all duty, loue &amp; obedience:</hi> For knovving him to be preſent, there is no need of renevving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeeches or thoughts that he is ſo; And really exhibiting all manner of reſpect to him, it vvould be to no purpoſe to make either internall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall profeſſions of it. He is in a readines to heare &amp; execute any commands; &amp; till he be informed by the <hi>King</hi> hovv he ought to performe his vvill &amp; ſeruice, he is not forvvard to voluntary vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. So does the ſoule (according to the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48407:371"/> of Roias,</hi>) behaue herſelfe in Gods Preſence, not renevving, but only perſeuering in the vertue of thoſe <hi>direct Acts of Faith, Loue, duty &amp;c:</hi> vvhich she framed in the beginning. If being in this vacancy &amp; <hi>Internall ſilence,</hi> Gods Spirit shall ſuggeſt vnto her any pure <hi>Affections,</hi> she is attentiue &amp; ready to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; quietly exerciſe them, &amp; preſently returnes to her ſilence.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If during this ſilence the ſoule find any <hi>Aridity, obſcurity</hi> or <hi>inſenſiblenes in Inferiour Nature</hi> &amp;c: thoſe things doe not interrupt her perſeuering in her ſilence &amp; vertuall Exerciſe of <hi>Faith, Oblation</hi> &amp; <hi>Reſignation,</hi> ioyned vvith a quiet attention to his vvill &amp; <hi>Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Yet if indeed she should forget herſelfe, &amp; that either vvandring thoughts or ſenſuall Affections should preſſe vpon her &amp; diuert her attention fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God (vvhich can ſcarce be vvhilſt she is vigilant to expell all images vvhatſoeuer that may cauſe her to breake her internall ſilence) she can eaſily recouer the ſaid <hi>Silent attention,</hi> by renevving (if need be) a short expreſſe Act of Faith of the Diuine Preſence &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In this Attention to God she is far from expecting any extraordinary <hi>Illuminations, fauours</hi> or <hi>Viſits,</hi> of vvhich she accounts herſelfe vtterly vnvvorthy.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> she has no ſuſpicion or feare leaſt ſuch a reſpectfull Silence should be meere Idlenes or ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for she knovves it to be the effect of loue and reſpect. And ſince an intellectuall ſoule is all Actiuity, ſo that it cannot continue a moment wi h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome deſires; the ſoule then reiecting all deſires
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48407:371"/> tovvards <hi>created Obiects,</hi> she cannot chuſe but tend inwardly in her affections to God; for vvhich end only she put herſelfe in ſuch a poſture of Prayer: Her tendance then being much like that of the <hi>mounting of an Eagle</hi> after a precedent vigorous ſpringing motion and extenſion of her vvings, the vvhich ceaſing, in vertue thereof the flight is continued for a good ſpace vvith a great ſvviftnes, but vvithall vvith great ſtillnes, quietnes &amp; eaſe, vvithout any vvauing of the vvings at all, or the leaſt force vſed in any member, being in as much eaſe &amp; ſtillnes as if she vvere repoſing in her neſt.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. This ſeemes to mee to be in ſumme <hi>the fashion</hi> of that <hi>Internall Prayer of Silence</hi> recommended by <hi>Roias;</hi> The vvhich vvithout any variation he would haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed daily, morning &amp; euening, allowing to each recollection about <hi>an houre.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Now the <hi>aduantages</hi> that he (not vvithout grounds of reaſon) attributes to it are. 1. <hi>That it cauſes</hi> far more profound Recollections, then any other kind of ſett internall Prayer: Becauſe a ſoule hauing either by a short <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> or exerciſe of <hi>Faith, obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp;c. found him vvho is the center of her repoſe, she then leaues all the roomes and appartements of ſenſe (both externall and internall) voyd &amp; empty, &amp; paſſes forvvard to thoſe of the Spirit, vvhich are pure, cleare and ſecure. 2. <hi>It doth extremely</hi> abate the <hi>Actiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> both of th <hi>imagination</hi> &amp; <hi>paſsions,</hi> neither of which doth it ſuffer to ſtir at all. 3. <hi>God is moſt perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated in it,</hi> being apprehended ſimply and truly by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48407:372"/> 
                           <hi>Faith</hi> in the Superiour ſpirit. For as long as there are <hi>diſcourſes</hi> in the <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> images permitted to reſt in the <hi>Fancy,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſenſible motions</hi> of tendernes in the <hi>heart,</hi> there God is not perfectly &amp; entirely the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of ſuch operations; <hi>In Spiritu, non in commotione Dominus,</hi> ſaith the Prophet Elias: <hi>God is not in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing wind,</hi> (he is not in the ſtirrings of Paſſions or of the imagination.) But <hi>(in ſibilo aurae tenuis) he is in the ſilent whiſper of a ſoft ayre.</hi> And ſaith <hi>Dauid (Factus eſt in pace locus eius) His place of abode is in the cleare &amp; peacefull Regions of the Spirit.</hi> 4. <hi>Moreouer by this exerciſe</hi> wee come to the moſt perfect operation of <hi>ſelfe-annihilation;</hi> by vvhich both our ſelues and all creatures are ſo tranſcended and forgotten, as if they vvere not at all; Neither can the deuill find vvhere to faſten a tentation.

                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48407:378"/> in our minds concerning him, by vvhich vvee doe perceiue that he is not any thing that vvee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or imagine, but an inexhauſtible <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Being &amp; Good,</hi> infinitly exceeding our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: The vvhich <hi>Being &amp; Good,</hi> vvhatſoeuer it is in it ſelfe, vvee loue vvith the vvhole poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of our vvills, embracing God beyond the proportion of our knovving him. But yet euen ſuch a <hi>Contemplation</hi> &amp; <hi>loue</hi> in this life, by reaſon of our bodily weakenes &amp; neceſſities, cannot be vvithout many deſcents and interruptions.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. This <hi>Mysticke Contemplation or vnion,</hi> is of <hi>two ſorts.</hi> 1. <hi>Actiue</hi> and ordinary: being indeed an habituall ſtate of perfect ſoules by vvhich they are enabled, vvhenſoeuer fit occaſion shall be, to vnite themſelues actiuely and actually to God by efficacious, feruent, amorous and conſtant, yet vvithall ſilent &amp; quiet, Eleuations of the Spirit. 2. <hi>Paſsiue</hi> &amp; extraordinary: the vvhich is not a ſtate, but an <hi>actuall Grace</hi> &amp; fauour from God, by vvhich he is pleaſed at certaine times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his free Good pleaſure to communicate a glimpſe of his Maieſty to the ſpirits of his ſeruants after a ſecret &amp; wonderfull manner. And it is called <hi>Paſsiue,</hi> not but that therin the ſoule doth actiuely Contemplate God: but she can neither vvhen she pleaſes diſpoſe herſelfe thereto, nor yet refuſe it when that God thinks good to operate after ſuch a manner in the ſoule, &amp; to repreſent himſelfe vnto her by <hi>a Diuine particular Image,</hi> not at all framed by the ſoule, but ſupernaturally infuſed into her. The
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48407:379"/> vvhich <hi>Grace</hi> is ſeldome, if euer, afforded but to ſoules that haue attained to the former ſtate of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Actiue Vnion.</hi> Concerning this <hi>Paſsiue Vnion,</hi> and the ſeuerall kinds of it, vvee shall ſpeake more hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. As for the former ſort, vvhich is <hi>Actiue Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,</hi> of vvhich vvee haue already treated in groſſe in this Chapter, vvee reade in <hi>Myſtick Authours, Thaulerus, Harphius &amp;c: That he</hi> that vvould become ſpirituall ought to practiſe the dravving of his externall ſenſes invvardly into his Internall, there looſing &amp; as it vvere annihilating them. <hi>Hauing done this,</hi> he muſt then dravv his Internall ſenſes into the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour povvers of the ſoule, &amp; there annihilate them likevviſe. <hi>And thoſe powers</hi> of the Intellectuall ſoule he muſt dravv into that vvhich is called their <hi>Vnity,</hi> vvhich is the principle &amp; Fountaine from vvhence thoſe Povvers doe flow &amp; in vvhich they are vnited. <hi>And lastly</hi> that <hi>Vnity</hi> (vvhich alone is capable of perfect vnion vvith God) muſt be applied and firmely fixed on God: And herein, ſay they, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the perfect <hi>Diuine Contemplation</hi> &amp; vnion of an Intellectuall ſoule vvith God.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Novv vvhether ſuch Expreſſions as theſe vvill abide the ſtrict examination of Philoſophy, or no, I vvill not take on mee to determine. Certaine it is, that by a frequent &amp; conſtant Exerciſe of Internall Prayer of the vvill, ioyned vvith Mortification, the ſoule comes to operate more &amp; more abſtracted from ſenſe, &amp; more eleuated aboue the corporall organs
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48407:379"/> &amp; faculties, ſo dravving nearer to the reſemblance of the operations of an <hi>Angell or</hi> ſeparated ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Yet this <hi>Abstraction</hi> &amp; <hi>Eleuation</hi> (perhaps) is not be vnderſtood, as if the ſoule in theſe pure ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations had no vſe at all of the Internall ſenſes or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Images: (for <hi>the Schooles</hi> reſolue, that cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt vvith the ſtate of a ſoule ioyned to a mortall body.) But ſurely her <hi>Operations</hi> in this pure Degree of Prayer are ſo <hi>ſubtile</hi> &amp; <hi>intime,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Images</hi> that she makes vſe of, ſo exquiſitly pure &amp; immateriall, that she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceiue at all that she vvorkes by Images. So that <hi>ſpirituall Writers</hi> are not much to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by perſons vtterly vnexperienced in theſe <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> affaires, if deliuering things as they perceiued by their ovvne Experience, they haue expreſſed them othervviſe then vvill be admitted in the Schooles.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Novv to this kind of purely Intellectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations doth a ſoule begin to arriue after a ſufficient Exerciſe of Immediate Acts of the vvill. And hauing attained thereto, they doe grovv more &amp; more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall &amp; ſublime by the Exerciſe of <hi>Aſpirations</hi> &amp; <hi>blind Eleuations,</hi> vvithout all limitt.</p>
                        <p n="14">14.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48407:380"/> generall, obſcure, confuſed notion of God, as Faith darkly teaches: &amp; this rather vertually then directly &amp; expreſſely: the maine buſines being to Eleuate the vvill, and vnite it to God ſo preſented.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. In vvhich Vnion (aboue all particular Images) there is neither time nor place: but all is <hi>Vacuity</hi> &amp; emptines: as if nothing vvere exiſtent but God &amp; the ſoule: Yea ſo far is the ſoule from reflecting on her ovvne exiſtence, that it ſeemes to her <hi>that God &amp; she are not diſtinct, but one only thing.</hi> This is called by ſome <hi>Myſtick Authours, the State of Nothingnes:</hi> by others <hi>the State of Totality:</hi> becauſe therin God is all in all, the container of all things. And the Prayer proper to this ſtate is thus deſcribed by <hi>a holy Hermite</hi> in <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> (collat. x. c. 11.) <hi>Ita ad illam Orationis incorruptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem mens noſtra perueniat &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>So vvill the mind aſcend to that pure ſimplicity of Prayer the which is freed from all intuition of Images, vndiſtinguished with any proſecution of words or ſenſes: but vttered inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by an inflamed intention of the mind, by an vnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable exceſse of affoction, and inconceiuable quicknes and alacrity of ſpirit. The which Prayer, the ſpirit being abstracted from all ſenſes &amp; ſenſible Obiects, doth powre forth vnto God by ſighes and grones that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">16. It is an errour therfore of vnexperienced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vvho thinke and ſay, that all the Exerciſes and thoughts of <hi>Contemplatiues</hi> are actually in Heauen, in interiour Conuerſation vvith <hi>Angells</hi> and <hi>Saints;</hi> taſting of the <hi>Ioyes of Paradice;</hi> or vvholly employed in <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48407:380"/> ſpeculations about Diuine Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation</hi> &amp;c: True it is that in a <hi>paſsiue Vnion,</hi> God may after a cleare and diſtinct but vvonderfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repreſent any, or all theſe things by a <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſpecies</hi> imprinted in the ſoule. But as for the proper Exerciſe of Actiue Contemplation, it conſiſts not at all in ſpeculation, but in blind Eleuations of the Will, and ingulfing it more and more profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in God, vvith no other ſight or knovvledge of him, but of an obſcure Faith only.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. This happy ſtate of <hi>Actiue Contemplation</hi> is for ſubſtance the moſt perfect that a ſoule is capable of in this life: Being almoſt an entire reparation &amp; reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule to the State of Primitiue Innocence, for as long as it laſts; becauſe then the ſoule is freed from all ſinfully diſtracting Images and affections that vvould ſeparate her from God. Herevpon a <hi>Holy Hermite</hi> in <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſayes, <hi>That except in the very actuall exerciſe of Contemplation, a ſoule is not only in an imperfect ſtate, bur alſo in an immediate diſpoſition to a ſinfull Defect: by reaſon that where God doth not wholly poſſeſſe the ſoule, the very Images of creatures cannot but, more or leſſe, defile her.</hi> Hovv comfortable therfore, &amp; how only ſecure is a life of Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Thoſe that are vnexperienced may and often doe call this <hi>a ſtate of Idlenes</hi> and vnproffitable ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Martha</hi> complained againſt <hi>her Siſter Mary:</hi> But thoſe that haue attained to a taſt of it know it to be the <hi>Buſines of all Buſineſſes,</hi> as <hi>S.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48407:381"/> from God intereſſe themſelues in externall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; nor perhaps employ much of their time and Deuotions in expreſſe Prayers for common neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: yet thoſe vnexpreſſible Deuotions vvhich they Exerciſe, &amp; in vvhich they tacitely inuolue the needs of the vvhole Church, are far more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent vvith God, then the buſy endeauours &amp; Prayers of ten thouſand others: A fevv ſuch ſecret &amp; vnknovvn ſeruants of God are the <hi>Chariots &amp; horſemen,</hi> the ſtrength and bulvvarkes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp; Churches vvhere they liue.</p>
                        <p n="19">19.

                        <p n="1">1. INTERNALL Prayer proper to the State of <hi>Actiue Contemplation</hi> conſiſts of certaine moſt <hi>purely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall operations of the Will,</hi> longing &amp; thirſting after <hi>God,</hi> &amp; <hi>an Vnion with him in the ſupreme point of the ſpirit,</hi> vvhere his moſt proper dvvelling is.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Perfect Operations</hi> are by <hi>Spirituall Authours</hi> ſeuerally named, as <hi>Eleuations, Inward stirrings of the ſpirit, Aſpirations</hi> &amp;c: Wee vvill in the follovving <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> make vſe for the moſt part of this laſt terme of <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> as moſt proper in a generall notion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſayd <hi>Operations.</hi> For 1. <hi>by them the ſoule</hi> in a Holy ambition doth <hi>aſpire,</hi> to rayſe &amp; eleuate her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48407:382"/> out of inferiour Nature, &amp; to mount to the <hi>Apicem ſpiritus,</hi> vvhich is Gods throne. 2. <hi>By them the ſoule</hi> being inflamed vvith Diuine Loue, doth <hi>breath</hi> forth her ardent affections to God, as the <hi>Heart</hi> forces the <hi>lungs</hi> to ſend forth that aire vvhich they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſucked in, that they may dravv in fresher aire, to refrigerate it: ſo that in both there is a quick <hi>recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call motion</hi> of emptying &amp; filling, of riſing &amp; falling. For after euery <hi>Aſpiration</hi> there is a short deſcent; &amp; then a mounting higher then before. 3. <hi>Becauſe as our outward breathing</hi> is an action as it vvere purely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, performed vvithout any labour at all, or ſo much as election: So a ſoule rooted in Charity breathes forth theſe pure Aſpirations vvithout any force vſed vpon herſelfe, they flovving from her freely, (both as to the matter and manner of them) &amp; in a ſort naturally. 4. <hi>Becauſe as the motions</hi> made in <hi>Breathing</hi> doe not hinder (but rather aduance) all other motions &amp; operations; ſo may <hi>Aſpirations</hi> be exerciſed during other ordinary Employments vvithout any preiudice to either, or vvithout any conſiderable diſtraction: Except they be ſuch Buſineſſes that doe require a ſpeciall fixed atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind vvith ſerious ſtudy. Novv in ſuch Employments, if they be impoſed by neceſſity or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the ſoule ought to quit her Aſpirations: And ſo doing, she vvill gaine as much by her Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as she vvould by Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Novv theſe <hi>Aſpirations</hi> are certaine <hi>short</hi> &amp; <hi>liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections</hi> of the ſoule, by vvhich she expreſſes a thirſty longing after God: ſuch as theſe are: <hi>My God,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48407:383"/> when shall I loue thee alone! When shall I be vnited to thee! Whom haue I in heauen or earth, but thee alone! O that thou wouldſt liue &amp; raigne alone in my ſoule. O my God, thou alone ſuffiſeſt mee! Doeſt not thou know, O my God, that I loue thee only? Let mee be nothing; &amp; be thou all, O my God. O loue! O loue! O infinite, vniuerſall Good! When shall I come &amp; appeare before the face of thee, O my God! Let mee loue thee only, &amp; that is ſufficient! When shall I dye, that my God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may liue in mee? &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Novv the ſame <hi>Affections</hi> (ſuch as theſe) that are vſed in the Prayer of <hi>Aſpirations,</hi> may alſo be vſed, for as much as concernes the expreſſion and ſenſe of them, in the exerciſe of <hi>immediate Acts,</hi> and euen in <hi>Meditation</hi> it ſelfe: But yet the manner by vvhich the ſoule produces the ſayd <hi>Affections</hi> are in many reſpects different in <hi>Perfect &amp; Imperfect ſoules:</hi> and the ſayd <hi>Aſpirations</hi> are of a quite different nature from other forced <hi>immediate Acts of the Will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. For <hi>firſt</hi> ſuch feruorous Affections tending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly &amp; immediately to God, are the <hi>entire matter</hi> in the Exerciſe of Aſpirations: Wheras in <hi>immediate Acts</hi> they are only novv &amp; then interlaced: But the ordinary matter of ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> is the doing or forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing for God, as in Acts of Reſignation &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Secondly</hi> in thoſe <hi>immediate Acts and Affections</hi> in vvhich there are no images of Creatures inuolued, but vvhich reſpect God immediatly, He is repreſented by ſome <hi>diſtinct Image,</hi> or expreſſe notion in the mind, as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48407:383"/> by ſome ſpeciall <hi>Attribute, Perfection, Name, Similitude</hi> &amp;c. But a ſoule after a long practiſe of <hi>Internall Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction</hi> &amp; renouncing of all repreſentations of God, contents herſelfe vvith ſuch a confuſed notion of him as may be apprehended by an <hi>Obſcure generall Faith:</hi> That is to ſay, not ſimply &amp; abſolutely vvith no kind of Image at all (for that is ſuppoſed inconſiſtent vvith the Operations of the ſoule vvhilſt it is in a mortall body:) but not vvith a diſtinct, formall, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>particular Image:</hi> for all ſuch offring themſelues, are reiected by perfect ſoules: So that if they were to giue an account of vvhat they conceiue in their minds vvhen they intend to thinke of God, all that they could ſay vvould be: <hi>God is nothing of all that I can ſay or thinke, but a Being infinitly beyond it, &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incomprehenſible by a created Vnderſtanding: He is what he is, and what himſelfe only perfectly knows; and ſo I beleiue him to be, &amp; as ſuch I adore and loue him only: I renounce all pretending to a diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and content my ſelfe with ſuch a blind beleiuing.</hi> Novv though <hi>imperfect ſoules</hi> alſo (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are learned) doe acknowledge this <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue apprehenſion of God</hi> to be only truly proper &amp; perfect; yet by reaſon that groſſe images are not yet chaſed out of their minds, they cannot in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall operations</hi> proceede conſtantly according to ſuch an acknovvledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Such an obſcure <hi>negatiue Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect</hi> vvill not ordinarily moue their Affections: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no other but ſuch an obiect vvill moue the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Perfect ſoules.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="254" facs="tcp:48407:384"/>7. <hi>Thirdly, Proper Aſpirations</hi> in Perfect ſoules haue <hi>no precedent Diſcourſe</hi> at all, as Acts haue, at leaſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: Neither doth the <hi>Will</hi> in <hi>Aſpirations</hi> intend to employ or make vſe of the vnderſtanding: for they are <hi>ſudden eleuations of the Will</hi> vvithout any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious motiue or Conſideration.</p>

                        <p n="24">24. <hi>Secondly</hi> in <hi>regard</hi> of <hi>ſenſible Deuotion,</hi> though <hi>the deuill</hi> may haue great influence vpon it in <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> or euen ſometimes in <hi>immediate affections</hi> and

                        <p n="25">25. <hi>Thirdly in regard of the Vnderstanding:</hi> vvheras it vvas before all be painted vvith Images of Creatures: yea vvhen it regarded God, it ſavv him by an Image of its ovvne creating: Novv the ſoule looſes all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it ſelfe and of all created things: And all that she retaines of God is a remembrance that he cannot be ſeene nor comprehended.

                        <p n="27">27. <hi>Fifthly in regard of the whole perſon:</hi> Till a ſoule be arriued vnto this Exerciſe, she neuer attaines to a perfect poſſeſſion of all Vertues vniuerſally. They are indeed all in an inferiour degree and vvith much mixture of naturall, ſenſuall ends produced by the former Exerciſes: And if ſome ſpeciall vertues ſeeme to be in a high Degree, it is either becauſe nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes more to them; or becauſe the practiſe of them may be more ſuitable to ſome deſignes of nature. But aſſoone as by the Exerciſe of Aſpirations Diuine Loue is far more perfectly exerciſed, the very <hi>Roote of all ſin (ſelfe loue)</hi> is diſtroyed, &amp; <hi>purity of Intention</hi> is practiſed to God for himſelfe only, and only by his
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48407:389"/> Inſtruction and motion. The <hi>Diuine Loue</hi> that the ſoule Exerciſed before vvas immediately vpon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vvith relation to God, and not directly and immediately to God himſelfe: Or if ſo ſometimes, yet it vvas vvith reflections vpon herſelfe. But in <hi>Aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> she exerciſes Loue only to God himſelfe vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reflections: vvhich cannot be exerciſed but by Soules perfectly mortified, being the <hi>higheſt Myſtick Contemplation</hi> poſſible to be exerciſed in this life. For as <hi>Alphonſus Madrilienſis</hi> ſaith, <hi>A Soule is neuer able to to produce a proper Act of loue to God, till she haue firſt gott a perfect hatred of herſelfe, which is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Degree of Mortification.</hi> The vvhich once attained, she is ripe for a <hi>Paſsiue Vnion,</hi> and perhaps at the very dore of it.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. The <hi>Authour of the Clowd,</hi> and likevviſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banſon</hi> doe vvith great reaſon teach, that after a Soule is mounted to this Degree of exerciſing loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly by Aſpirations, she is not in any difficulty, Aridity &amp;c: to deſcend to any Inferiour Exerciſe: Herein differing from <hi>F.

His reſiſtance indeed vvas ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, that God told him, that if he had not knovvn that it proceeded from true (but indiſcreet) Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he vvould preſently haue caſt him into Hell for it.</p>

Thoſe therfore that are fauoured vvith extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Graces,</hi> if they did duly conſider their ſtate and danger, vvould find little ground to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or to deſpiſe others that are in a more lovv, but vvithall far more ſecure vvay.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Novv for the preuenting and auoyding the great danger of ill vſing ſuch <hi>Fauours</hi> and Diuine Graces, to the feeding of ſelfe loue and Pride, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Authours</hi> doe, ſeriouſly enioyne ſuch Perſons ſo viſited by God not to truſt their ovvne Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to determine vvhether they come from God or not: and much leſſe to put in practiſe any thing of conſequence vpon ſuch <hi>Reuelations:</hi> but to refer themſelues to the Iudgment and Aduice of others.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. And herein great care is to be had to chuſe pious and diſcreet Directours: becauſe too many there are that vvill too readily and ſuddenly reſolue ſuch matters to come from none but God: and vvill thereupon deſire ſuch perſons to intercede for them, and to begge ſome particular Fauours of the like nature &amp;c. Novv vpon ſuch indiſcreet beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in thoſe that should be Directours, ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vvill begin to thinke that God loues to treate vvith them, and vvill interpret the things declared vnto them according to their ovvne Guſt and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: And if things shall fall out othervviſe then they imagined, they will fall into Melancholick ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, and great danger of the Deuills ſnares.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. The beſt Courſe that a <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> in this caſe can take is, if there be any rationall Grounds of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48407:395"/> probability that ſuch Viſions &amp;c. doe not come from God, to exhort and enioyne the Perſons to auoyd and deſpiſe them. Yea and if after long and ſerious examination it should ſeeme almoſt euident to him that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Authour</hi> of them: yet ought he ſo to behaue himſelfe both in vvords and Actions, as to deterre the ſoule from adhering to them vvith Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: rather inclining her to a ſuſpicion and feare, or hovveuer to an indifferency about them, vvith an aſpect of loue to God himſelfe only, vvho is aboue all his Gifts, and ought to be the only Obiect of our loue. And thus if the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> behaue himſelfe, he may be ſure that he vvill preuent all harme to enſue, and he shall performe a Seruice very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. Certainly the danger is far leſſe to be too difficult in beleiuing and eſteeming ſuch things, then to be neuer ſo little too credulous and inclind to admire them. For it were better that good ones should be ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuſpected, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that an ill one should be once beleiued. And therfore wee doe find that <hi>our Bleſſed Lord</hi> appearing to <hi>S. Tereſa</hi> did neither take it ill from her, nor from her <hi>Directour,</hi> vvhen by his order she did ſpitt at <hi>him</hi> and defye <hi>him</hi> ſo appearing to her: but he only informed her hovv she should giue conuincing proofes that it vvas no Illuſion.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. <hi>B. Iohn de Cruce</hi> giues very good <hi>Aduices</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point: Exhorting ſoules as the ſureſt vvay, that in caſe they cannot meete vvith a prudent and experienced <hi>Confeſſarius,</hi> they should not ſpeake one
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48407:396"/> vvord concerning ſuch Graces; but to paſſe them ouer and to make no account of them. And hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer by no meanes, of their ovvne heads, to proceede to the executing of any thing ſignifyed after ſuch an vnuſuall manner.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. And though it should happen that the Soule being ſo diſpoſed as to make no great eſtimation of ſuch things (vvhich vvill be a great ſecurity from danger by them) shall therfore thinke it to no purpoſe to conſult vvith a prudent Directour about ſuch trifles: Or if on the other ſide ſuch Reuelations ſeeme vnto her ſo abſolutely cleare and vnqueſtionable that there is no need at all to aske any ones iudgment about them: Yet ſaith <hi>the ſame Authour,</hi> it vvill be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that she diſcouer them to her <hi>Spirituall Maiſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="33">33. And the reaſons are. 1. <hi>Becauſe</hi> ordinarily ſuch is Gods order and diſpoſition, to the end that by ſuch an humble ſubmiſſion of herſelfe a nevv light and Grace may be communicated to her. 2. <hi>To the end</hi> that vpon ſuch an occaſion she may be put in mind to reſtraine her Affections from ſuch things, and be eſtablished in true Nakednes and Pouerty of Spirit. For vvhich End the <hi>Confeſsarius</hi> ought not to inſiſt vpon the <hi>Excellency</hi> of ſuch <hi>Fauours:</hi> but (paſſing ouer them ſleightly) to encourage the Soule rather to value and tend to a perfect Actiue Vnion by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and pure Prayer. 3. <hi>That</hi> by ſuch an occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, the ſoule may conquer that naturall vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vvhich is in ſome to diſcouer vvhat things paſſe vvithin them. And vvith ſuch ſoules the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi>
                           <pb n="279" facs="tcp:48407:396"/> is to deale mildly, not affrighting or ſcandalizing them, nor disheartning them from dealing freely: That by this meanes ſuch <hi>Viſions, Extaſies</hi> &amp;c. may produce in them that effect vvhich probably God intended, namely by them to call Soules to a nearer and more perfect Actiue Vnion by Loue; Wherof one perfect act framed by the Will is of more vvorth, and more gratefull to God, then all the Viſions and Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all things that paſſe in Heauen and Earth can be. And certaine it is, that many ſoules vvhich are neuer viſited vvith any ſuch Fauours, are yet far more aduanced in Spirit, and more neare to God, then are ſome others vvho frequently enioy ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Fauours.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. Whatſoeuer it be that is ſuggeſted in ſuch a Reuelation, vvhether it concerne Knovvledge or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, though in it ſelfe it be of neuer ſo ſmall moment, yet vvithout <hi>Aduice</hi> a ſoule ought neither to aſſent to it, nor execute it: For vvhatſoeuer the thing it ſelfe be, yet conſidering the cauſe &amp; meanes by vvhich it comes (vvhich is ſuppoſed to be ſupernaturall;) it becomes of great importance. Yea the meere conuerſation &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity vvith an intellectuall Spirit is a matter of great conſequence: And as being vvith <hi>a good Spirit,</hi> it is likely to be occaſion of much Good: So being vvith <hi>a bad Spirit</hi> (as it may vvell be ſuppoſed to be till the contrary be euident) it vvill probably cauſe very much harme.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. A ſoule being to conſult vvith others about ſuch matters, ought to take heed that she fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48407:397"/> impertinences, but as <hi>Aluarez de Paz</hi> aduiſeth, let her humbly, breifly &amp; clearly manifeſt ſo much of theſe extraordinary matters to her Directour, as may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to enable him to iudge: And if he doe not much value them, let her ſimply hold on her courſe, and ſecurely proceede in her ordinary exerciſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. If ſome eminently Perfect Soules haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ovvne light in iudging of theſe things and practiſing accordingly, vvithout conſulting others. This ought not to preiudice the foregoing Aduices; vvhich are indeed for Soules leſſe experienced and Perfect, and ſuch as in <hi>S.

                        <p n="37">37. In ſuch caſes likevviſe all ſoules are not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly obliged to reſigne their iudgements and wills to others, as utterly to neglect their ovvne proper <hi>Call</hi> receiued from God. For to a vvell-minded ſoule that vvalkes and deales ſimply and plainly vvith God; and labours diligently to keepe her Affections free from all created things, aſpiring to an indifference, vvhether she haue or vvants them: yea out of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and a pious feare rather deſires to vvant ſuch extraordinary viſitations; Such a Soule doubtleſſe vvill be ſo guided and illuminated by Gods holy Spirit, as she vvill perfectly knovv vvhat to doe &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, and vvhether, vvhen, and of vvhom to aske Counſell.

                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Firſt</hi> in regard of the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> there is therby a <hi>Diuine Light</hi> communicated: not reuealing or diſcouering any <hi>new Verities,</hi> but affording a moſt firme, cleare aſſurance and experimentall perception of thoſe <hi>Verities</hi> of <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> vvhich are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of our <hi>Faith:</hi> the vvhich aſſurance the ſoule perceiues to be Diuinely Communicated to her.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>O happy Euidence</hi> of our <hi>Catholick Beleife! No thankes</hi> to them that beleiue after ſuch ſight, vvhich is more euident then any thing vvee ſee vvith our corporall Eyes. Surely the firſt knovvledge and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the <hi>Primitiue Chriſtians</hi> had of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Religion came by ſuch Contemplations communicated to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> &amp;c. (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> vvitneſſes of himſelfe for one:) Who ſavv and euen felt the truth of vvhat they preached, and deliuered by <hi>Tradition</hi> to others.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Such <hi>Contemplations</hi> as this made <hi>S. Tereſa</hi> ſo
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48407:400"/> confident in the <hi>Points</hi> of her <hi>Beleife,</hi> that it ſeemed to her that she vvas able to diſpute vvith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all the <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the vvorld. But yet therin she might perhaps be deceiued, if that God did not further enable her then by ſuch Contemplations only. For though they ſerued to eſtablish moſt firmely her ovvne Beleife, yet vvould they not ſuffiſe to enable her to diſpute vvith and conuince others: <hi>Becauſe</hi> neither could she intelligibly enough expreſſe vvhat she had ſeene: And if she could, yet vvould not all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue her; nor were they rationally obliged to doe ſo. And therfore doubtles she vvould neuer haue vndertaken of her ovvne accord vvithout a ſpeciall Motion and inuitation from God to haue entred into any ſuch Diſputes. Indeed if God had vrged her therto, then doubtles he vvould haue giuen her an eſpeciall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and force.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. A ſoule that is nevvly avvakened, as it vvere, from ſuch a Contemplation or Vnion, coming to reade the holy Scriptures or any Spirituall Booke, vvill peirce far more deeply into the Verities contained in them &amp; vvill ſee clearer Lights, and feele far more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Taſts</hi> of the <hi>Diuine Truthes</hi> therin, then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: So that all the knowledge that she formerly had, vvill ſeeme vnto her meere darknes, and a knovvledge of the <hi>outward letter</hi> only: vvheras novv she penetrates into the internall <hi>Spirit</hi> of the vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. In <hi>the next place,</hi> the change that is made by this <hi>Supernaturall Vnion,</hi> vvith regard to the Will &amp; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48407:401"/> is equally admirable: In ſo much as many yeares ſpent in mortification &amp; other Internall Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes will not ſo purify the ſoule, as a fevv minutes paſſed in ſuch a Diuine Inaction. Here it is indeed that a ſoule perfectly <hi>feeles her owne nothing, and Gods to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, &amp; thereby</hi> is ſtrangely aduanced in Humility &amp; the Diuine Loue. For being ſo immediatly vnited to God, ſo illuſtrated vvith his heauenly light, &amp; inflamed vvith his loue, all Creatures (&amp; herſelfe aboue all) are become as <hi>nothing,</hi> yea perfectly odious to her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there are many ſecret <hi>defects</hi> in a ſoule ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile &amp; Intime, that they can neither he cured, nor ſo much as diſcouered but by <hi>a Paſsiue Vnion.</hi> In ſo much as hereby the ſoule is aduanced to Perfection in a manner &amp; Degree not to be imagined, far more efficaciouſly then by all the former actions of her life putt together: ſo that the follovving <hi>Aſpirations</hi> &amp; <hi>Eleuations</hi> of <hi>the ſpirit</hi> become far more pure &amp; effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then before. And indeed vvere it not for ſuch good <hi>Fruits</hi> &amp; effects vpon the <hi>Will,</hi> ſuch <hi>Paſsiue Vnions</hi> vvould be little proffitable vnto the ſoule. For <hi>our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit conſists in our owne free Acts produced in vertue of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Grace aſsiſting vs,</hi> &amp; not in the operations ſimply vvherin <hi>God</hi> is only <hi>Agent,</hi> &amp; vvee <hi>Patients.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">15. In the <hi>third place</hi> theſe <hi>ſupernaturall Vnions</hi> are of that vertue that they doe vvholly ſubdue the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> &amp; other <hi>Internall ſenſes</hi> to the <hi>Superiour Soule:</hi> ſo that they cannot as they liſt vvander to &amp; fro, but are reduced to ſuch a happy ſeruitude to the ſpirit, that vvithout any ſtreſſe or violence they are brought
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48407:401"/> to attend it in all its employments &amp; occaſions. Or if the <hi>Imagination</hi> doe ſometimes vvander, yet it neuer faſtens it ſelfe vvith delight on any externall peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing obiects, by reaſon that ſelfe-loue is in a ſort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished in the ſoule, ſo that it may eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: or hovvſoeuer by its vvandrings it doth not hinder or interrupt the operations of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. <hi>Moreouer</hi> it is obſerued by <hi>Mysticks,</hi> that ſoules vvhich formerly during the precedent leſſe perfect Exerciſes vvere of quite different, euen contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions &amp; naturall complexions, after ſuch <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Vnions</hi> do come to a very <hi>neare reſemblance to one an other: (As wee ſee</hi> that ſeuerall vvaies or pathes vvhich from far diſtant places leade to a Citty, the nearer they approach to the Citty, the nearer alſo doe they come to one an other, &amp; at laſt fall into, &amp; make one common high vvay.) And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe nature &amp; its particular affections &amp; inclinations are novv ſo vvorne &amp; euen burnt out by the fire of Diuine Loue &amp; Grace, that it is the Spirit of God that is the only principle of all their Actions: the vvhich therefore muſt needs be vniforme &amp; like to one another.</p>
                        <p n="17">17.

                        <p n="1">1. A Soule hauing once experienced ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Diuine Fauours, will be apt to ſay vvith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>(Non mouebor in aeternum) I shall neuer be moued, thou Lord of thy Goodneſſe haſt made my Hill ſo ſtrong.</hi> But if she thinke ſo, she vvill find herſelfe ſtrangely deceiued. For as the vvhole courſe of a ſpirituall life conſiſts of perpetuall changes, of Eleuations and depreſſions; &amp; an extraordinary <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> is vſually attended by ſucceeding anguish &amp; <hi>Deſertion:</hi> So aboue all other times, this ſo ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent &amp; ſo comfortable a <hi>Diuine Viſitation</hi> is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follovved by a moſt terrible vnexpected <hi>Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A Deſolation</hi> ſo vnſupportable to ſoules vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided or vnaware of it, that many not enabled, or not vvell inſtructed how to behaue themſelues in it, haue loſt all heart to proſecute Internall vvayes: &amp; ſo bereauing themſelues of the benefit of all their former exerciſes, &amp; Diuine Paſſiue Inactions,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48407:403"/> haue returned to a Common extrouerted life.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The vvhich truly is <hi>a miſery</hi> ſo great and ſo deplorable, that to preuent the like in others, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue requiſite to giue warning of it: and by a breife deſcription of the nature and manner of ſuch a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi> together vvith the <hi>good ends</hi> for vvhich <hi>God</hi> permits, yea in a ſort conducts ſoules into it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to beare themſelues in it vvith <hi>Patience, Reſignation, &amp; tranquillity of mind.</hi> I shall be breife in this Point, remitting the Readers for a farther Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to <hi>Barbançon,</hi> as likewiſe to that excellent <hi>Treatiſe</hi> called <hi>Interiour Abnegation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. From the foreſaid ſublime familiarities therfore and communications betwene God &amp; his choſen ſoules, he conducts them vſually (eſpecially after the <hi>firſt Paſsiue Vnion</hi>) to another far different <hi>state of pure ſuffrance;</hi> But this is not a happy ſuffring (as formerly) from God, but a vvofull ſuffring from the ſoule herſelfe. For <hi>God</hi> for ſome time retiring himſelfe from her, permits her to feele her naturall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And this he does by degrees, leaſt if the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and bitternes of this ſtate did <hi>at once</hi> ſeiſe vpon her, she should be vtterly oppreſſed by the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Therfore vvhen by many inferiour Trialls of her Patience and Reſignation he ſees her ſtrong &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly reſolued to follovv him vvhitherſoeuer he shall leade her, then he puts her to this laſt &amp; of all other <hi>greatest Triall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. For <hi>firſt</hi> he not onely vvithdravves all comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table obſeruable infuſions of Light &amp; Grace, but
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48407:403"/> alſo depriues her of a povver to Exerciſe any percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible operations of her Superiour Spirit, &amp; of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable reflexions vpon his loue, plunging her into the depth of her <hi>Inferiour Powers.</hi> Here conſequently her former calmenes of Paſſions is quite loſt, neither can she interouert herſelfe: ſinfull motions &amp; ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions doe violently aſſault her, &amp; she finds as great difficulty (if not greater) to ſurmount them, then at the beginning of a ſpirituall Courſe. The feeling of all this is intolerable to her: and thervpon she begins to ſuſpect that by ſome great vnknovvn ſin she has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured all this: or hovveuer that her reſiſtance is now ſo feeble and inefficacious, that she deſerues that God should quite caſt herof. She finds the corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her nature ſo ſtrong in her, that she thinks she is <hi>nothing but Nature:</hi> the rebelliouſnes vvhereof, &amp; its rage againſt God is vnexpreſſible. She is novv as full of Images of Vanities as euer she had bene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: and it ſeemes to her that she has far leſſe povver to expell them, then vvhen she liued in the vvorld. If she vvould eleuate her Spirit, she ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Clovvds &amp; darkneſſe: She ſeekes God and cannot find the leaſt markes or footſteps of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Something there is that hinders her from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the ſinfull ſuggeſtions vvithin her; but vvhat that is, she knovves not: for to her thinking she has no Spirit at all: And indeed she is now in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of all other moſt diſtant from Spirit and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall operations, I meane ſuch as are <hi>perceptible.</hi> Her <hi>Prayers</hi> &amp; recollections are moſt greiuous vnto her
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48407:404"/> becauſe infinitely difficult, by reaſon that ſenſe and nature (vvhich moſt abhorrs them) is novv almoſt only Actiue and operatiue in her. And the <hi>Recollections</hi> vvhich she endeauours to make, are not only inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide, but, as it ſeemes to her, vtterly inefficacious: ſo that she oft ſuſpects that it vvere better perhaps if she vvere quite extrouerted. Yet for all that she dares not altogether quitt her endeauours to practiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections: but yet she knovvs not vvhy.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Now if all theſe diſorders continued only for ſome short time, she might vvithout extreme difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty practiſe Patience, as she did in her former Aridities and deſolations. But alas, this moſt afflicting Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome oftentimes continues many monthes, yea in ſome perſons ſeuerall yeares; (not alvvaies in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but vvith ſome interciſions:) ſo that the ſoule comes in a manner to looſe all Patience. She often complaines in her Prayers to God for deſerting her that vvould faine not deſert him: yet vvhen she makes ſuch Prayers, to her ſeeming her Spirit vvill not ioyne: If she had nothing to doe but meerly to ſuffer, it vvere not ſo much: But she knovves it is her duty to vvorke, and to raiſe herſelfe vp by Prayer: and this she cannot doe. She ſtands in need novv of as <hi>groſse operations</hi> to cauſe an <hi>Introuerſion,</hi> as euer: and yet thoſe groſſe operations haue not ſo good an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as in her former imperfect ſtate.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Moreouer the Tentations vvhich she novv ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, are both ſo violent, and her reſiſtance ſo feeble: They are vvithall ſo vnexpected, ſo ſecret and ſubtile,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48407:404"/> that notvvithſtanding any information that she former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had by Reading or othervvayes, touching ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuffring to be expected: yet vvhen it comes, she vvill ſcarce be perſvvaded that this can be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a vvay to Perfection, or conducing to her good. All her former light and inſtructions vvill ſcarce at all diminish her reſentment of her deplorable condition. She looſes nothing of her former Light (for ſoules arriued to this ſtate are not to ſeeke, or to learne how and in vvhat manner they are to exerciſe themſelues interiourly: they ſtudy no more for that, then one vvould doe hovv he may ſee vvith his eyes, or heare vvith his eares, hauing the Perfect vſe of his ſenſes:) But vvhen she is to practiſe according to this light, she has no ſatisfaction at all. If she haue any difficulties or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities, it is hovv she is to comport herſelfe in externall matters: &amp; euen this obſcurity is but very ſmall. But hovveuer she thinks that all the light she has ſerues to little purpoſe: finding that notvvithſtanding it she vvorkes as if she had no light at all. In a vvord, she novv ſees her ovvne naturall miſery ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (yea and can ſee nothing but it) that she cannot ſee hovv God can comfort her, if he vvould.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. All this shevves that notvvithſtanding all her precedent Exerciſes, yea that during the foregoing <hi>Diuine Inactions,</hi> yet many dreggs of corrupt nature did remaine in her: they vvere only hid, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. This therfore vvas the onely forcible <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> left to deſtroy in a manner all the ſinfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of nature in her. Indeed to naturall reaſon
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48407:405"/> this ſeemes a ſtrange and moſt improper Remedy, to deſtroy nature by ſuſpending the Influences and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Grace, and by ſuffring nature to breake forth violently vvithout any controule and reſtraint, all ſenſible light in the vnderſtanding, and feruour in the vvill being in a manner extinguished. Yet out of this darkenes God produces Light, and ſtrength from this Infirmity.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. For the truth is, that in this caſe of <hi>Deſolation</hi> the ſoule doth by her <hi>Free Will,</hi> or rather in the center of the Spirit beyond all her faculties, remaine in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Vnion &amp; adheſion to God: although no ſuch Vnion doe appeare vnto her, yea though it ſeemes to her that she is not only eſtranged, but euen auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God: And by vertue of that moſt ſecret but firme adheſion, she makes election of God as her only Good: The vvhich may to any but herſelfe ſufficiently appeare by her cariage during that State. For she breakes not out into any murmurings: she ſeekes not to comfort herſelfe by admitting any inordinate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſolaces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not doth any thing deliberately, by vvhich to rid herſelfe from ſuch an afflicting Eſtate, ſooner or othervviſe then God vvould haue her to doe. She practiſes Tranquillity of mind in the midſt of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of paſſions in ſenſitiue nature: She exerciſes Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without the leaſt contentment to herſelfe therin: she learnes Patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the midſt of impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the midſt of irreſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In a vvord, she yeilds her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>as a prey</hi> vnto Almighty God, to be caſt into this moſt sharpe <hi>Purgatory of Loue.</hi> The vvhich is an immediate
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48407:405"/> Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition to an eſtablished State of Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. More particularly, the <hi>Fruits</hi> &amp; <hi>Benefits</hi> flovving from this moſt ſad eſtate (ſupported vvith Patience &amp; Tranquillity of ſpirit) are vvonderfull. 1. <hi>For firſt</hi> hereby the deuout ſoule obtaines a nevv Light to penetrate into the <hi>Myſtery of our Lords deſertion</hi> in the <hi>Garden</hi> &amp; on the <hi>Croſse:</hi> &amp; from this light a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed loue to him: <hi>Now</hi> she ceaſes to vvander vvhy <hi>he</hi> should deprecate a cupp ſo mortally bitter as this: &amp; that it should vvorke ſuch ſtrange effects on him; or that he should cry out, <hi>Eli, Eli, lammaſabacthani:</hi> &amp; by this Deſertion of his (vvhich laſted till the very laſt moment of his life) she hopes to haue an end put to hers. 2. <hi>Now she learnes</hi> by experience to make <hi>a Diuiſion</hi> betvvene the <hi>ſupreme Portion</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and <hi>inferiour Nature:</hi> yea betvvene the <hi>Summity</hi> of the Spirit and the faculties of the ſame. For that <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of her by vvhich she cleaues to God, ſeemes to be <hi>an other third perſon</hi> diſtinct from her ſelfe that ſuffers, complaines and deſires. For she chuſes God, and at the ſame time feares that her Will chuſes and conſents to ſin: she is mightily ſupported by God, and yet she thinkes him vtterly eſtranged and ſeparated from her. Thus at laſt she perceiues that she can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vvithout any perceptible vſe of her Faculties. 3. <hi>Hereby she learnes</hi> a perfect <hi>diſappropriation</hi> and Tranſcendence euen of the higheſt Gifts and Graces of God: and a contentation to be depriued of the greateſt Bleſſings that God has to beſtovv on her (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only Himſelfe.) 4. <hi>The ſight of</hi> the vnexpreſſible
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48407:406"/> vveakeneſſe and peruerſneſſe of nature left to it ſelfe vvithout any ſenſible Influences of Grace vpon the inferiour faculties, produces in her a moſt profound Humility and Hatred of herſelfe. 5. <hi>Laſtly by this most sharpe Purgatory of Loue</hi> she enters into a ſtate of moſt Perfect Confidence in God, of Tranquillity of mind, and Security of Gods vnchangeable Loue to her, not to be diſturbed by any poſſible future Affliction. For vvhat has a ſoule left to feare, that can vvith a peaceable mind ſupport, yea and make her benefit of the Abſence of God himſelfe?</p>

                        <p n="1">1. IT remaines only for <hi>a concluſion</hi> of the vvhole Booke, that ſomething be ſayd of the <hi>End of all theſe Exerciſes of Mortification and Prayer,</hi> in vvhich there is ſo great variety of Degrees and changes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And ſurely that <hi>End</hi> muſt needs be <hi>ſupereminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent,</hi> for the attaining vvhereof ſuch incredible labour (both interiour and exteriour) muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and vvhereto ſuch vvonderfull Diuine <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Viſits are only instrumentall Diſpoſitions. Suſo</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his ovvne Experience concerning the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Paſſiue Vnion by vvhich a ſoule hath a diſtinct Vievv of <hi>of God her Originall,</hi> ſayes, That though the ſayd Contemplation continued but as it vvere a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſo replenished his Heart vvith ioy, that he vvondred it did not cleaue aſunder. On the other ſide
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48407:407"/> vpon the ſubſequent moſt contrary Viſitation by a ſpirituall Deſertion, the Heart becomes ſo replenished vvith bitterneſſe and Anguish, as if all <hi>Gilead</hi> had not <hi>Balme</hi> enough to aſſvvage it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And for vvhat <hi>End</hi> all this? Surely not that a man should reſt finally in the Ioy conceiued by ſuch a frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor meerly to torture the ſoule by ſuch a bitter Deſolation. <hi>Our ſupreme Happines is not Receiuing but Louing.</hi> All theſe fauours therfore, and all theſe ſuffrings doe <hi>end</hi> in this, namely <hi>the accomplishing of this Loue in our ſoules.</hi> So that <hi>all our Perfection conſiſts in a ſtate of Loue, and an entire Conformity with the Diuine Will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. There are therfore in a Spirituall Life <hi>no</hi> ſtrange <hi>Nouelties</hi> or <hi>wonders</hi> pretended to <hi>Diuine Loue is all. It begins with Loue and Reſignation: and there it ends like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe.</hi> All the Difference is in the <hi>Degrees</hi> &amp; luſter of it. Loue euen in its moſt imperfect State is moſt diuinely Beautifull: the vvhich Beauty is vvonderfully encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Exerciſe. But vvhen by ſuch fiery Tryalls and Purifications, as alſo by ſo neare approaches as are made to the Fountaine of Beauty and Light in Paſſiue Vnions, <hi>this loue</hi> is exalted to its Perfection; Hovv nevv, hovv admirable and incomprehenſible to vs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſoules, is the manner of the Exerciſing of it? vvee muſt content our ſelues to heare thoſe ſpeake of it that haue had ſome experience in it: And if vvhat they ſay be incomprehenſible to vs, vvee ought not to vvonder at it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That vvhich the forementioned <hi>Suſo</hi> (in his Ninth Rocke) vvrites of the nature of this Loue in groſſe, is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48407:407"/> not ſo abſtruſe. <hi>O how ſmall</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is the number of thoſe Perfect ſoules! And yet as few as they are, God ſets them as Pillars to ſupport his Chruch; So that if it were not for them, it would be in danger to be diſſipated. The Prayer of one ſuch ſoule is of more efficacy then of all Christians beſides. They approach very neere to God their Originall: and yet ſuch is the vile esteeme that they haue of themſelues, they themſelues are not aſſured of this. Yet by fits a certaine Clarity or Glimpſe of their Prime Principle is Communicated to them, by which they eaſily inferre that there is ſome other thing within them from whence thoſe ſplendours doe iſſue. But they are ſo purely, ſimply and nakedly reſigned to God in Catholick beleife, that whenſoeuer they receiue any ioyfull conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from him, they are more apprehenſiue, then when they find themſelues depriued of it. For their only deſire is ſimply to imitate the Example of our Lord Ieſus in ſimple Faith. They adhere ſo purely and ſimply to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, that they neither deſire nor endeauour to know any thing elſe. There is in them ſo profound an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, that they esteeme themſelues vnworthy of any of thoſe ſecret and Comforting Graces of God: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dare not aske them. They deſire no other thing but this, that God may be perfectly Glorified. They are ſo abſolutely reſigned to the Diuine will, that whatſoeuer befalls them and all other Creatures, is moſt acceptable to them. Therfore if God giue them any thing, they are contented with it: If he depriue them of it, they are as well pleaſed. Thus they Challenge nothing: they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate nothing. Yet if it were left to them, they would chuſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48407:408"/> rather to auoyd pleaſing, then bitter things. For the Croſſe is their ſoueraigne delight. They feare neither Life nor Death, Purgatory nor Hell, nor all the Deuills in it. For all ſeruile feare is vtterly extinguished in them. And the only Feare remaining is this, that they doe not as yet imitate the Example of our Lord, as they ought &amp; deſire. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They reſent no Tentations nor Afflictions: It is their Ioy to follow our Lord bearing his Croſſe. To the laſt gaſpe they deſire to walke in no other way but this. And although they be vnknown vnto the world, yet the world is well known vnto them. Theſe are truly Men indeed: True Adorers of God, that Adore him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> Thus <hi>Suſo.</hi>

                  <p>Yet becauſe the Authour referreth the Dames his Schollers to his larger explication by vvord of Mouth in many places, and to his practiſe, in vvhich he ſetled them: both vvhich can not be knovvne but by thoſe vvho knevv the Authour; and this Myſticke vvay, though moſt plaine, moſt ſecure, and moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to perfection, containeth many hard &amp; delicate points, vvhich vvill ſeeme ſtrange to ſuch as haue been only accuſtomed to intellectuall Meditation, and litle to affectiue Praier, by reaſon of the great abſtraction, vvhich it requires from all things that are not God.</p>
                  <p>Leaſt the enſuing Confeſſours, and Directours should miſtake the meaning of the Authour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon alter the courſe of Praier begunne and ſetled in the houſe, (as vvee hope, to the Glory of God &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall proffit of Soules in Perfection proper to our Calling) I haue thought conuenient to note theſe fevv points follovving.</p>

Whereupon it follovveth, that allthough in this Life, our fraile &amp; vveake body hindreth our ſoule, that our Prayer cannot be ſo perfectly mentall &amp; vocall, as it shall be in heauen: yet muſt our mentall Prayer be ſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, that by the grace of God, &amp; ioy all perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48407:419"/> in vnion vvith him, our Vocall Prayer in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire may be conuerted into mentall; that is, that our vocall ſaying &amp; ſinging may be ſo liuely anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it vvere, &amp; informed vvith affect of the ſoule, as if it vvere altogether ſpirituall Prayer. And ſo shall vvee fullfill the vvords of our Rule <hi>(Nihil praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur operi Dei) Nothing preferred before the Office of the quire.</hi> Whereas in diuers places the Authour ſaith that all bodily exerciſes, euen frequenting the Sacraments, vvithout mentall Prayer, &amp; abſtraction, &amp; mortification, doe not aduance a ſoule one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ot in ſpirit: although it be plaine enough to them that knovv the neceſſity of theſe 3. Inſtruments of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perfection, yet leaſt any should miſtake his meaning, as if theſe former exerciſes did not prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a ſoule at all, vvithout theſe Inſtruments practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by fevv; out of the former aduices the reader muſt vnderſtand that by <hi>Aduancement in ſpirit,</hi> is meant here, not the bare auoyding of groſſer ſins, &amp; ſome perfection too in Actiue Life, vvhich is gotten by theſe bodily exerciſes; but a cleare &amp; experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall knovvledge of the vvill of God, &amp; a ſpiritualizing of the ſoule by adhering to God, &amp; tranſcending all creatures vvhatſoeuer; for this doe the Myſtick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours call <hi>aduancement in ſpirit;</hi> &amp; this cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto but by the three aboue named inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments continually practiſed &amp; employed by Gods grace. Which notvvithſtanding the Authour denieth not, but that a ſoule vvithout the foreſaid exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, may ſo proffit in ſpirit, (as Actiue ſoules doe that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48407:419"/> liue in vvordly manner) that they may carefully auoyd ſin &amp; keepe Gods commandements, &amp; be truly vnited to God in follovving his vvill, by the vſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſes &amp; frequency of Sacraments, although they vſe not much Mentall Prayer, abſtraction &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. For if they vſe none at all (as no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian but vſeth them in ſome degree) vndoubtedly they vvill not proffit at all in ſpirit, neither actiuely nor contemplatiuely, nor auoyde ſin, nor be in any ſort vnited to God.</p>
                  <p>About the doctrine of <hi>Confeſsion;</hi> vvheras the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour diſputeth much againſt the vſing of Confeſſion of veniall ſins, as neceſſary to Spirituall proffit: it is to be vnderſtood that he doth not in any vviſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the diſcreete vſe of frequent Confeſſion; but only the needleſſe numeration of veniall ſins, &amp; daily defects, vvhich ſome ſoules doe make in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions vvith great anxiety of mind; &amp; ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours doe oblige their penitents vnto vvith great preiudice of that chearfull Liberty of Spirit, vvhich a ſoule should haue to conuerſe in Prayer vvith God; &amp; is commonly a cauſe of ſcrupules, one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt baines of ſpirituall Perfection. So that for ſoules that are by nature prone to feare &amp; ſcrupuloſity, the Directour of neceſſity muſt moderate them both in the frequency of Confeſſion, &amp; matter to be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yea he may aduiſe them to confeſſe fewer times then other freer ſoules doe. Othervviſe for ſoules that are chearfull &amp; valiant &amp; couragious in the vvay of the Spirit; the Authour obligeth them in his practiſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48407:420"/> to keepe the ordinary time of Confeſſion: Much more thoſe that are not altogether ſo carefull in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding occaſions of ordinary defects. I ſay, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth them in ſuch ſort as the: Conſtitutions oblige, vvhich is not vnder any ſin, as if they should ſin as often as they omitt the ordinary time of Confeſſion: but as a laudable counſell &amp; proffitable obſeruance, vvhich vnder a penalty &amp; regular correction is to be kept, &amp; not omitted but by aduice of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Father or leaue of the Superiour.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo that he doth vvorthily aduertiſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of many vvho come to Confeſſion making the principall intention of it only the Abſolution from ſin; I ſay this is a defect, becauſe the principall part of the intention muſt be the encreaſe of Grace, and loue of God, by vvhich formally infuſed or povvred into our ſelues, God Almighty doth blott out ſins &amp; vvipe them avvay. Now although Abſolution from ſin is neuer giuen vvithout infuſion of grace, yet ought the intention of the Penitent to be principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the obtaining of Grace; for if he principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the abſolution of ſin, it is a reflexion of the ſoule vpon its ovvne proffit by ſelfe-loue deſiring to auoyde the vvrath of God, &amp; punishment due to ſin, &amp; to be freed from the deformity of guiltines; vvhich though it be a good deſire; yet it is but a property of Beginners in loue, &amp; nothing comparable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Grace, vvhich is the perfect loue of God, &amp; is an eleuation of the ſoule to tranſcend it ſelfe &amp; all creatures, to liue only in God.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:48407:420"/>
                  <p>About the doctrine of <hi>ſett Examens of Conſcience,</hi> the Authour doth not condemne it, eſpecially for ſoules vvho are not greatly aduanced in perfection; but for ſoules vvhich dayly proffit &amp; grovv in Grace; he prefers the exerciſe of loue: &amp; not vvithout cauſe; for his meaning is, That in our Recollection, it is an eaſier &amp; ſpeedier vvay to amend our ſelues, by vvrapping all our defects in a generality, &amp; ſo endeauouring to conſume them; as it vvere caſting them into the fire of loue then by particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, &amp; diſcuſſing them in ſingular: becauſe in ſo doing they diſtract the mind, that may be better employed. Yet this Doctrine hinders not, but if any notable defect haue bene committed, it should be by a particular reflexion amended; yet rather by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous conuerſion of the ſoule to God by Humility, then by turning it ſelfe to looke vpon the defect in particular. And doubtleſſe a ſoule that according to the Authours Doctrine, doth ſo carefully auoyd all defects, that it preſently vpon ſight of any default, exacteth an amendment of it ſelfe; ſuch a ſoule needeth no <hi>ſett Examen,</hi> but ſuplieth the vſe thereof by a more noble exerciſe, vvhich is as I tearmed it, an humble conſuming of all her defects in one bundle in the heauenly fire of Charity, or loue of God.</p>
                  <p>Neuertheleſſe a ſet Examen is proffitable for ſuch as are not yet come to ſuch a height of Vnitiue loue, &amp; is counſelled by our <hi>father Bloſius</hi> in diuerſe places, &amp; by <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doth our Authour diſcommend this ſet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen, but the defectiue vſe of it; vvhich is 1. to make it in order to Confeſſion: vvhich doubtleſſe in a ſoule vvell aduanced breedeth needleſſe images, ſince ſuch a ſoule vvill call to mind vvhat ſuffiſeth for her ordinary Confeſſion vvithout this examen. 2. Too much particularizing of our defects; vvhich is likevviſe diſtractiue, it being ſufficient to examine the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our duty &amp; obligatory actions, or if any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table defect haue careleſſely crept vpon vs: All other defects being more proffitably vvrapped vp in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, &amp; ſo caſt into our Sauiours paſſion; then parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſtirred vp, vvhich vvould in a manner but raiſe a new duſt in the ſoule. 3. The anxious looking vpon the defects in themſelues &amp; in their peculiar matter or obiect; vvhereas it is better &amp; ſafer to turne the eye of our ſoule from the matter in particular vnto God Allmighty, humbling our ſelues before him, &amp; vvith louing reuerence or auing pardon of him; A 4 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is, to imagine that it it is a ſin in carefull ſoules to omitt this Examen: vvhereas indeed it is none at all: though in ſoules that be careleſſe of their actions, it be ordinarily a defectiue negligence vvorthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48407:422"/> of Perfection, &amp; to all that be not ſo vvary in their Actions; But if the Directour perceiue a ſoule to be ſo vvary, that she is perpetually carefull of progreſſe in Spirit, &amp; neuer deferreth correction &amp; amendment of her defects, but out of hand redreſſeth vvhat she diſcouereth to be amiſſe: to ſuch a ſoule may the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour permit inſteed of a ſet Examen, to vſe her ordinary eleuation of heart to God, &amp; by vertuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition or actuall (as God moueth her) included in the exerciſe of loue, deface all the defects of her life.</p>
                  <p>Let none likevviſe be ſcandaliſed at that vvhich is ſaid, that there be higher exerciſes then <hi>Meditation of the Paſsion:</hi> &amp; that it is not allvvaies the proffitableſt vvay to buſy our ſoule in that obiect. For ſince our Religious heare ordinarily 2. Maſſes, or at leaſt one dayly, in that they doe actually celebrate the memory of our Sauiours Paſſion; &amp; at diuers other times they haue leaſure to thinke louingly therevpon, that they need not in all their Recollections take that only obiect; eſpecially ſince their manner of prayer is more by Act of vvill, then by conſideration of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; &amp; (as is very vvell declared in one place) all their recollections &amp; actions that haue any other ſpeciall obiect are vertually intended in honour of our Sauiours Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>What is ſaid about <hi>paſsiue Contemplation,</hi> that it is rather receiued into the ſoule, then produced or vvrought by our ovvne action or endeauour, is moſt true; ſuppoſing allvvaies that this reception of it in our ſoule is a vitall operation; (vvhich vvhether it be called
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48407:422"/> an action of the ſoule or a mere paſſion, is a Schoole queſtion &amp; nothing to our purpoſe.) Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that by all our ovvne power vvee could not produce it, &amp; therefore it is called the <hi>Inaction of God</hi> in our ſoule, by many Myſticks, to vvhich vvee only concurre by vitall receiuing it, &amp; by a vvilling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to let God vvorke his vvill in vs.</p>
                  <p>What is ſaid about the <hi>immediate operation of God in the very eſsence &amp; ſubstance of our ſoule, &amp; not in the powers thereof,</hi> nor by mediation of the powers, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be againſt the generall doctrine of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers &amp; Schoole men, yet is it a probable opinion, &amp; grounded vpon experience of deuout men, that vvere alſo great Schollers; &amp; therefore may ſecurely be follovved: As alſo that vvhich is there ſayed, <hi>that God can moue the will to loue without the operation of the vnderſtanding,</hi> though many deny it, yet is it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable &amp; befitting the Allmighty povver of God; &amp; held by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> &amp; <hi>S.
